  ### Question
  
  ```
  A company collects data for temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure in cities across multiple continents. The average volume of data that the company collects from each site daily is 500 GB. Each site has a high-speed internet connection. The company wants to store this data in a central data lake on AWS that is highly scalable and cost-effective. Data should be available for analytics within 24 hours of collection. Â  
  
  Which approach will meet these requirements?
  
  A. Use Amazon S3 as the data lake. Ingest data directly into S3 from each site using AWS DataSync.
  
  B. Use Amazon S3 as the data lake. Ingest data from each site into Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, and then use AWS Lambda to write the data to S3.
  
  C. Use Amazon S3 as the data lake. Ingest data into Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose from each site, and configure it to deliver data to S3.
  
  D. Use Amazon S3 as the data lake. Set up an Amazon EC2 instance at each site to compress and batch the data, and then transfer the data to S3 using SCP.
