An Amazon EC2 instance is located in a private subnet in a new VPC. This subnet does not have outbound internet access, but the EC2 instance needs the ability to download monthly security updates from an outside vendor. What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

-   [ ] A. Create an internet gateway, and attach it to the VPC. Configure the private subnet route table to use the internet gateway as the default route.
-   [ ] B. Create a NAT gateway, and place it in a public subnet. Configure the private subnet route table to use the NAT gateway as the default route.
-   [ ] C. Create a NAT instance, and place it in the same subnet where the EC2 instance is located. Configure the private subnet route table to use the NAT instance as the default route.
-   [ ] D. Create an internet gateway, and attach it to the VPC. Create a NAT instance, and place it in the same subnet where the EC2 instance is located. Configure the private subnet route table to use the internet gateway as the default route.

-   [ ] B. Create a NAT gateway, and place it in a public subnet. Configure the private subnet route table to use the NAT gateway as the default route.
   
Why these are the correct answers:

B. Create a NAT gateway, and place it in a public subnet. Configure the private subnet route table to use the NAT gateway as the default route.

-   [ ] A NAT gateway in a public subnet allows instances in private subnets to access the internet.
-   [ ] The private subnet's route table directs outbound traffic to the NAT gateway.
-   [ ] This solution enables the EC2 instance to download updates securely.
   
Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. An internet gateway allows public subnets to access the internet, but not private subnets.
-   [ ] C. A NAT instance requires more management than a NAT gateway. Placing it in the same subnet is incorrect.
-   [ ] D. Combining an internet gateway and a NAT instance is unnecessary and incorrect.

Therefore, Option B is the correct solution.

A solutions architect needs to design a system to store client case files. The files are core company assets and are important. The number of files will grow over time. The files must be simultaneously accessible from multiple application servers that run on Amazon EC2 instances. The solution must have built-in redundancy. Which solution meets these requirements?

-   [ ] A. Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)
-   [ ] B. Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)
-   [ ] C. Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive
-   [ ] D. AWS Backup

  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] A. Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)
   
Why these are the correct answers:

A. Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)

-   [ ] Amazon EFS provides scalable file storage for use with EC2 instances.
-   [ ] It supports concurrent access from multiple EC2 instances.
-   [ ] EFS is designed with built-in redundancy and scalability.
   
Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] B. Amazon EBS is block storage and can only be attached to a single EC2 instance at a time.
-   [ ] C. Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive is for long-term archival, not concurrent access.
-   [ ] D. AWS Backup is for backup and recovery, not for providing shared file storage.

Therefore, Option A is the correct solution.

A solutions architect has created two IAM policies: Policy1 and Policy2. Both policies are attached to an IAM group.

A cloud engineer is added as an IAM user to the IAM group. Which action will the cloud engineer be able to perform?

-   [ ] A. Deleting IAM users
-   [ ] B. Deleting directories
-   [ ] C. Deleting Amazon EC2 instances
-   [ ] D. Deleting logs from Amazon CloudWatch Logs
   
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] C. Deleting Amazon EC2 instances
   
Why these are the correct answers:

C. Deleting Amazon EC2 instances

-   [ ] Policy 1 allows all EC2 actions.
-   [ ] Policy 2 denies "ds:Delete\*" actions.
-   [ ] Deny statements override allow statements, but the cloud engineer is still allowed to delete EC2 instances.

<hr>
Why are the other answers wrong?
<hr>

-   [ ] A. The engineer can't delete IAM users because it's not in Policy 1.
-   [ ] B. "ds:Delete\*" denies deleting directories.
-   [ ] D. "logs:Get\*" and "logs:Describe\*" do not allow deleting logs.

Therefore, Option C is the correct answer.
