-   [ ] B. Write orders to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.
    Use EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer to read from the SQS queue and process orders into the database.

Why these are the correct answers:

B. Write orders to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.
Use EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer to read from the SQS queue and process orders into the database.

-   [ ] Amazon SQS decouples the order processing from the application, allowing orders to be queued during high traffic.
-   [ ] Auto Scaling groups ensure that there are enough EC2 instances to process the orders from the queue, and the Application Load Balancer distributes the workload.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. Increasing the EC2 instance size might help temporarily but does not address the queuing of orders during traffic spikes.
    SNS is for pub/sub messaging, not for reliable queuing of order data.
-   [ ] C. Similar to A, SNS is not suitable for reliable order queuing.
-   [ ] D. Scheduled scaling does not react to immediate traffic spikes.
    It also adds complexity compared to Auto Scaling based on queue depth.

Therefore, Option B is the most reliable and scalable solution.
