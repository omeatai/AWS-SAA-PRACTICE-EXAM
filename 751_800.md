A solutions architect is designing an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) authorization model for a company's AWS account. The company has designated five specific employees to have full access to AWS services and resources in the AWS account. The solutions architect has created an IAM user for each of the five designated employees and has created an IAM user group. Which solution will meet these requirements?

-   [ ] A. Attach the AdministratorAccess resource-based policy to the IAM user group. Place each of the five designated employee IAM users in the IAM user group.
-   [ ] B. Attach the SystemAdministrator identity-based policy to the IAM user group. Place each of the five designated employee IAM users in the IAM user group.
-   [ ] C. Attach the AdministratorAccess identity-based policy to the IAM user group. Place each of the five designated employee IAM users in the IAM user group.
-   [ ] D. Attach the SystemAdministrator resource-based policy to the IAM user group. Place each of the five designated employee IAM users in the IAM user group.

-   [ ] C. Attach the AdministratorAccess identity-based policy to the IAM user group. Place each of the five designated employee IAM users in the IAM user group.

Why these are the correct answers:

C.  Attach the AdministratorAccess identity-based policy to the IAM user group. Place each of the five designated employee IAM users in the IAM user group.

-   [ ] IAM policies are used to grant permissions to IAM users, groups, or roles.
-   [ ] `AdministratorAccess` is a predefined policy that provides full access to AWS services and resources.
-   [ ] Attaching this policy to an IAM user group and adding the employees' IAM users to the group is the correct way to give those users full access.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A and D. Resource-based policies are attached to AWS resources (like S3 buckets), not IAM user groups.
-   [ ] B. `SystemAdministrator` is not a standard AWS predefined policy name.

Therefore, Option C is the correct solution to provide full access to the designated employees.

A company has a multi-tier payment processing application that is based on virtual machines (VMs). The communication between the tiers occurs asynchronously through a third-party middleware solution that guarantees exactly-once delivery. The company needs a solution that requires the least amount of infrastructure management. The solution must guarantee exactly-once delivery for application messaging.

Which combination of actions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

-   [ ] A. Use AWS Lambda for the compute layers in the architecture.
-   [ ] B. Use Amazon EC2 instances for the compute layers in the architecture.
-   [ ] C. Use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) as the messaging component between the compute layers.
-   [ ] D. Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queues as the messaging component between the compute layers.
-   [ ] E. Use containers that are based on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) for the compute layers in the architecture.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] A. Use AWS Lambda for the compute layers in the architecture.
-   [ ] D. Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queues as the messaging component between the compute layers.

Why these are the correct answers:

A.  Use AWS Lambda for the compute layers in the architecture.

-   [ ] AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that requires minimal infrastructure management.

D.  Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queues as the messaging component between the compute layers.

-   [ ] SQS FIFO queues provide exactly-once delivery, ensuring that messages are processed only once and in the order they are sent.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] B. Amazon EC2 instances require significant infrastructure management.
-   [ ] C. Amazon SNS is a publish/subscribe service that does not guarantee exactly-once delivery.
-   [ ] E. Amazon EKS involves managing Kubernetes infrastructure, which is contrary to the requirement for minimal infrastructure management.

Therefore, the combination of AWS Lambda for compute and Amazon SQS FIFO queues for messaging meets the requirements for minimal infrastructure management and exactly-once delivery.

-   [ ] A. Deploy AWS Transfer for SFTP and an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system for storage. Use an Amazon EC2 instance in an Auto Scaling group with a scheduled scaling policy to run the batch operation.

Why these are the correct answers:

A.  Deploy AWS Transfer for SFTP and an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system for storage. Use an Amazon EC2 instance in an Auto Scaling group with a scheduled scaling policy to run the batch operation.

-   [ ] AWS Transfer for SFTP provides a managed SFTP service, reducing operational overhead.
-   [ ] Amazon EFS provides scalable and shared file storage.
-   [ ] An Auto Scaling group with a scheduled scaling policy ensures high availability and resilience by automatically managing EC2 instances based on the schedule.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] B and C. Deploying and managing an EC2 instance with a Linux and SFTP service involves more operational effort than using AWS Transfer for SFTP. Using an Auto Scaling group with the minimum and desired instances set to 1 does not provide high availability.
-   [ ] D. Modifying the application to pull files from Amazon S3 adds complexity. While S3 is scalable, it is object storage, not a file system, making EFS a better fit for applications expecting a file system interface.

Therefore, Option A provides the most managed, highly available, and resilient solution with the least operational overhead.

A company has users all around the world accessing its HTTP-based application deployed on Amazon EC2 instances in multiple AWS Regions. The company wants to improve the availability and performance of the application. The company also wants to protect the application against common web exploits that may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. Static IP addresses are required.

What should a solutions architect recommend to accomplish this?

-   [ ] A. Put the EC2 instances behind Network Load Balancers (NLBs) in each Region. Deploy AWS WAF on the NLBs. Create an accelerator using AWS Global Accelerator and register the NLBs as endpoints.
-   [ ] B. Put the EC2 instances behind Application Load Balancers (ALBs) in each Region. Deploy AWS WAF on the ALBs. Create an accelerator using AWS Global Accelerator and register the ALBs as endpoints.
-   [ ] C. Put the EC2 instances behind Network Load Balancers (NLBs) in each Region. Deploy AWS WAF on the NLBs. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution with an origin that uses Amazon Route 53 latency-based routing to route requests to the NLBs.
-   [ ] D. Put the EC2 instances behind Application Load Balancers (ALBs) in each Region. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution with an origin that uses Amazon Route 53 latency-based routing to route requests to the ALBs. Deploy AWS WAF on the CloudFront distribution.

  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] B. Put the EC2 instances behind Application Load Balancers (ALBs) in each Region. Deploy AWS WAF on the ALBs. Create an accelerator using AWS Global Accelerator and register the ALBs as endpoints.

Why these are the correct answers:

B.  Put the EC2 instances behind Application Load Balancers (ALBs) in each Region. Deploy AWS WAF on the ALBs. Create an accelerator using AWS Global Accelerator and register the ALBs as endpoints.

-   [ ] Application Load Balancers (ALBs) are suitable for HTTP-based applications and can distribute traffic across EC2 instances.
-   [ ] AWS WAF provides protection against web exploits and can be integrated with ALBs.
-   [ ] AWS Global Accelerator improves global application performance by using static IP addresses and routing traffic through the AWS global network.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A and C. Network Load Balancers (NLBs) are designed for TCP and UDP traffic, not HTTP. While Global Accelerator can work with NLBs, WAF cannot be directly deployed on NLBs.
-   [ ] D. While CloudFront can improve performance, it is primarily a CDN and does not provide static IP addresses for the application endpoints. WAF is better placed at the ALB for direct application protection.

Therefore, Option B is the most suitable solution to improve availability, performance, and security while providing static IP addresses.

A company's data platform uses an Amazon Aurora MySQL database. The database has multiple read replicas and multiple DB instances across different Availability Zones. Users have recently reported errors from the database that indicate that there are too many connections. The company wants to reduce the failover time by 20% when a read replica is promoted to primary writer. Which solution will meet this requirement?

-   [ ] A. Switch from Aurora to Amazon RDS with Multi-AZ cluster deployment.
-   [ ] B. Use Amazon RDS Proxy in front of the Aurora database.
-   [ ] C. Switch to Amazon DynamoDB with DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) for read connections.
-   [ ] D. Switch to Amazon Redshift with relocation capability.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] B. Use Amazon RDS Proxy in front of the Aurora database.

Why these are the correct answers:

B.  Use Amazon RDS Proxy in front of the Aurora database.

-   [ ] Amazon RDS Proxy manages database connections, reducing the number of open connections to the database.
-   [ ] It can also improve failover times by maintaining connections during failover events.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. Switching to Amazon RDS with Multi-AZ does not address the connection management issue or directly improve failover time in the same way as RDS Proxy.
-   [ ] C. Switching to Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service and is not suitable for replacing a MySQL database. DAX is a cache for DynamoDB, not RDS.
-   [ ] D. Amazon Redshift is a data warehousing service and is not designed for online transaction processing like Aurora MySQL.

Therefore, Option B is the most appropriate solution to manage connections and improve failover time for the Aurora database.

A company stores text files in Amazon S3. The text files include customer chat messages, date and time information, and customer personally identifiable information (PII). The company needs a solution to provide samples of the conversations to an external service provider for quality control. The external service provider needs to randomly pick sample conversations up to the most recent conversation. The company must not share the customer PII with the external service provider. The solution must scale when the number of customer conversations increases. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

-   [ ] A. Create an Object Lambda Access Point. Create an AWS Lambda function that redacts the PII when the function reads the file. Instruct the external service provider to access the Object Lambda Access Point.
-   [ ] B. Create a batch process on an Amazon EC2 instance that regularly reads all new files, redacts the PII from the files, and writes the redacted files to a different S3 bucket. Instruct the external service provider to access the bucket that does not contain the PII.
-   [ ] B. Create a web application on an Amazon EC2 instance that presents a list of the files, redacts the PII from the files, and allows the external service provider to download new versions of the files that have the PII redacted.
-   [ ] D. Create an Amazon DynamoDB table. Create an AWS Lambda function that reads only the data in the files that does not contain PII. Configure the Lambda function to store the non-PII data in the DynamoDB table when a new file is written to Amazon S3. Grant the external service provider access to the DynamoDB table.

  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] A. Create an Object Lambda Access Point. Create an AWS Lambda function that redacts the PII when the function reads the file. Instruct the external service provider to access the Object Lambda Access Point.

Why these are the correct answers:

A.  Create an Object Lambda Access Point. Create an AWS Lambda function that redacts the PII when the function reads the file. Instruct the external service provider to access the Object Lambda Access Point.

-   [ ] S3 Object Lambda allows you to add your own code to S3 GET requests to modify and process data as it is being retrieved.
-   [ ] By creating a Lambda function to redact PII and accessing it through an Object Lambda Access Point, the original data remains unchanged, and the external provider only receives redacted data.
-   [ ] This solution scales well and has minimal operational overhead.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] B. A batch process on an EC2 instance requires managing the instance and the batch process, increasing operational overhead. It also involves creating and managing a separate S3 bucket for redacted data.
-   [ ] C. A web application on an EC2 instance involves significant operational overhead for managing the instance, the application, and access control.
-   [ ] D. Storing non-PII data in DynamoDB adds complexity and cost, and it is not necessary since the requirement is to provide access to the files themselves, not the data within them.

Therefore, Option A is the most efficient and scalable solution with the least operational overhead.

-   [ ] C. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to recover the EC2 instance in case of failure.

Why these are the correct answers:

C.  Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to recover the EC2 instance in case of failure.

-   [ ] A CloudWatch alarm can monitor the EC2 instance and trigger an automated recovery action if the instance becomes unhealthy.
-   [ ] This helps to improve recovery time.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. Termination protection prevents accidental termination but does not help with recovery from failures.
-   [ ] B. Configuring for Multi-AZ deployment typically involves running multiple instances, which is not allowed in this scenario.
-   [ ] D. RAID configurations on EBS volumes improve storage redundancy but do not address instance-level failures.

Therefore, Option C is the most suitable solution to improve recovery time for the EC2 instance.

A media company stores movies in Amazon S3. Each movie is stored in a single video file that ranges from 1 GB to 10 GB in size. The company must be able to provide the streaming content of a movie within 5 minutes of a user purchase. There is higher demand for movies that are less than 20 years old than for movies that are more than 20 years old. The company wants to minimize hosting service costs based on demand.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

-   [ ] A. Store all media content in Amazon S3. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move media data into the Infrequent Access tier when the demand for a movie decreases.
-   [ ] B. Store newer movie video files in S3 Standard. Store older movie video files in S3 Standard-infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA). When a user orders an older movie, retrieve the video file by using standard retrieval.
-   [ ] C. Store newer movie video files in S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Store older movie video files in S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval. When a user orders an older movie, retrieve the video file by using expedited retrieval.
-   [ ] D. Store newer movie video files in S3 Standard. Store older movie video files in S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval. When a user orders an older movie, retrieve the video file by using bulk retrieval.

-   [ ] B. Store newer movie video files in S3 Standard. Store older movie video files in S3 Standard-infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA). When a user orders an older movie, retrieve the video file by using standard retrieval.

Why these are the correct answers:

B.  Store newer movie video files in S3 Standard. Store older movie video files in S3 Standard-infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA). When a user orders an older movie, retrieve the video file by using standard retrieval.

-   [ ] S3 Standard provides low latency and high throughput, suitable for frequently accessed newer movies.
-   [ ] S3 Standard-IA offers lower storage costs for infrequently accessed data (older movies) with a retrieval time within minutes, meeting the 5-minute requirement.
-   [ ] Standard retrieval in S3 Standard-IA is cost-effective for less frequent access.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. Using S3 Lifecycle policies to move data based on demand might not meet the 5-minute retrieval requirement, as the movement process can take time.
-   [ ] C. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval has retrieval times that can exceed 5 minutes unless expedited retrieval is used, which is more expensive. S3 Intelligent-Tiering is good for unknown access patterns but not optimized for known access patterns.
-   [ ] D. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval with bulk retrieval has retrieval times that are too long (hours) and do not meet the 5-minute requirement.

Therefore, Option B provides the most cost-effective solution while meeting the retrieval time requirements.

-   [ ] D. Develop an on-premises custom identity broker application or process that uses AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to get short-lived credentials.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] D. Develop an on-premises custom identity broker application or process that uses AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to get short-lived credentials.

Why these are the correct answers:

D.  Develop an on-premises custom identity broker application or process that uses AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to get short-lived credentials.

-   [ ] AWS STS allows you to request temporary security credentials for users authenticated via a custom identity broker.
-   [ ] This approach enables integration with non-SAML compatible LDAP directories.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) primarily uses SAML for identity federation and does not directly integrate with LDAP in the way described.
-   [ ] B. IAM policies define permissions, not authentication mechanisms. They do not integrate LDAP.
-   [ ] C. Rotating IAM credentials does not provide a direct authentication mechanism for LDAP users to the AWS Management Console.

Therefore, Option D is the most suitable solution for authenticating users from a non-SAML compatible LDAP directory to the AWS Management Console.

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] C. Create an SQS access policy that provides the other company access to the SQS queue.

Why these are the correct answers:

C.  Create an SQS access policy that provides the other company access to the SQS queue.

-   [ ] SQS access policies control access to the queue itself and allow you to grant permissions to other AWS accounts.
-   [ ] This enables the other company to access the queue without needing to manage IAM permissions in the development team's account.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. Instance profiles are for EC2 instances to assume IAM roles, not for granting queue access to other accounts.
-   [ ] B. IAM policies are attached to IAM users, groups, or roles within the same account, not for cross-account queue access.
-   [ ] D. SNS access policies control access to SNS topics, not SQS queues.

Therefore, Option C is the correct solution for providing cross-account access to the SQS queue.

A company built an application with Docker containers and needs to run the application in the AWS Cloud. The company wants to use a managed service to host the application. The solution must scale in and out appropriately according to demand on the individual container services. The solution also must not result in additional operational overhead or infrastructure to manage.

Which solutions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

-   [ ] A. Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) with AWS Fargate.
-   [ ] B. Use Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) with AWS Fargate.
-   [ ] C. Provision an Amazon API Gateway API. Connect the API to AWS Lambda to run the containers.

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] A. Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) with AWS Fargate.
-   [ ] B. Use Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) with AWS Fargate.

Why these are the correct answers:

A and B are correct because:

-   [ ] Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS are both managed container orchestration services.
-   [ ] AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with both ECS and EKS.
-   [ ] Fargate removes the need to manage the underlying infrastructure (EC2 instances), thus reducing operational overhead.
-   [ ] Both ECS and EKS with Fargate can automatically scale containerized applications based on demand.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] C. Provisioning an Amazon API Gateway API and connecting it to AWS Lambda to run containers is not a direct or efficient way to manage and scale general-purpose containerized applications. API Gateway is designed for managing APIs, and Lambda is for event-driven functions, not long-running container workloads.
-   [ ] D and E. Using Amazon EC2 worker nodes with ECS or EKS requires managing the EC2 instances, which contradicts the requirement to minimize operational overhead. While these solutions can scale, they involve more management than using Fargate.

An ecommerce company is running a seasonal online sale. The company hosts its website on Amazon EC2 instances spanning multiple Availability Zones. The company wants its website to manage sudden traffic increases during the sale. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

-   [ ] A. Create an Auto Scaling group that is large enough to handle peak traffic load. Stop half of the Amazon EC2 instances. Configure the Auto Scaling group to use the stopped instances to scale out when traffic increases.
-   [ ] B. Create an Auto Scaling group for the website. Set the minimum size of the Auto Scaling group so that it can handle high traffic volumes without the need to scale out.
-   [ ] C. Use Amazon CloudFront and Amazon ElastiCache to cache dynamic content with an Auto Scaling group set as the origin. Configure the Auto Scaling group with the instances necessary to populate CloudFront and ElastiCache. Scale in after the cache is fully populated.
-   [ ] D. Configure an Auto Scaling group to scale out as traffic increases. Create a launch template to start new instances from a preconfigured Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] D. Configure an Auto Scaling group to scale out as traffic increases. Create a launch template to start new instances from a preconfigured Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

Why this is the correct answer:

-   [ ] Auto Scaling allows the application to automatically adjust its capacity in response to traffic changes, ensuring it can handle sudden increases.
-   [ ] Using a launch template with a preconfigured AMI enables quick and consistent provisioning of new EC2 instances.
-   [ ] This approach optimizes costs by only using the necessary resources at any given time, scaling out during high demand and scaling in when demand decreases.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. Keeping instances stopped and starting them when needed can introduce latency and is less efficient than dynamically scaling. It also doesn't fully utilize Auto Scaling's capabilities.
-   [ ] B. Setting a fixed minimum size for the Auto Scaling group, large enough to handle peak traffic, is not cost-effective. Resources are wasted during periods of low traffic.
-   [ ] C. While CloudFront and ElastiCache improve performance by caching content, they don't, by themselves, address the scaling of EC2 instances. Auto Scaling is still needed to handle traffic volume, and the complexity of scaling in after cache population adds unnecessary overhead.

A solutions architect must provide an automated solution for a company's compliance policy that states security groups cannot include a rule that allows SSH from $0.0.0.0/0$. The company needs to be notified if there is any breach in the policy. A solution is needed as soon as possible.

What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

-   [ ] A. Write an AWS Lambda script that monitors security groups for SSH being open to $0.0.0.0/0$ addresses and creates a notification every time it finds one.
-   [ ] B. Enable the restricted-ssh AWS Config managed rule and generate an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification when a noncompliant rule is created.
-   [ ] C. Create an IAM role with permissions to globally open security groups and network ACLs. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to generate a notification every time the role is assumed by a user.
-   [ ] D. Configure a service control policy (SCP) that prevents non-administrative users from creating or editing security groups. Create a notification in the ticketing system when a user requests a rule that needs administrator permissions.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] B. Enable the restricted-ssh AWS Config managed rule and generate an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification when a noncompliant rule is created.

Why this is the correct answer:

-   [ ] AWS Config provides pre-built, managed rules like `restricted-ssh` that automatically check for compliance.
-   [ ] Config can directly integrate with Amazon SNS to provide notifications, automating the alerting process.
-   [ ] This approach minimizes operational overhead as it uses existing AWS services for compliance checking and notifications, rather than requiring custom code or complex setups.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. Writing a Lambda function requires custom code and ongoing maintenance, increasing operational overhead.
-   [ ] C. Creating IAM roles with broad permissions is a security risk and doesn't directly address the compliance requirement. Monitoring role assumption is less effective than directly checking security group rules.
-   [ ] D. Using SCPs to prevent users from creating security groups is overly restrictive and can hinder legitimate use cases. It also requires a separate ticketing system for handling exceptions, increasing operational overhead.

  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] B. Create a VPC Lattice service network. Associate the microservices with the service network. Define HTTPS listeners for each service. Register microservice compute resources as targets. Identify VPCs that need to communicate with the services. Associate those VPCs with the service network.

Why this is the correct answer:

-   [ ] VPC Lattice is designed to simplify service-to-service communication and connectivity.
-   [ ] It provides automatic service discovery, handles HTTPS communication, and manages connectivity across different VPCs and accounts.
-   [ ] This reduces the administrative overhead of setting up and managing complex networking configurations.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. Using an inspection VPC with a Network Firewall and transit gateway adds significant complexity and overhead for managing firewall rules and routing.
-   [ ] C. Using NLBs and PrivateLink requires more manual configuration of load balancers, endpoint services, and endpoints, increasing administrative overhead.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] C. Add an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis layer in front of the database.

Why this is the correct answer:

-   [ ] Amazon ElastiCache for Redis is an in-memory data store that provides sub-millisecond latency, which can significantly speed up metadata retrieval.
-   [ ] Redis supports complex data structures and operations, making it suitable for caching game metadata.
-   [ ] ElastiCache also offers capabilities like snapshots and replication for data durability and availability.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. Migrating to Amazon Aurora with Aurora Replicas might improve read scalability, but it's still a database and won't provide the sub-millisecond latency needed for very fast metadata retrieval.
-   [ ] B. Migrating to Amazon DynamoDB with global tables is a NoSQL solution that can provide scalability and replication, but it may not be the best fit for complex metadata queries and might not offer the same performance as an in-memory cache for this use case.
-   [ ] D. Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached is also an in-memory cache, but it is simpler than Redis and may not offer the same level of data structure support or advanced features needed for this application.

Why these are the correct answers:

A.  Add the development team's OU Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to the launch permission list for the AMIs.

-   [ ] Adding the development team's OU ARN to the launch permissions allows all accounts within that OU to launch instances from the AMIs.

C.  Update the key policy to allow the development team's OU to use the AWS KMS keys that are used to decrypt the snapshots.

-   [ ] KMS keys are used to encrypt the snapshots. The development OU needs permission to use these keys to launch instances from the AMIs.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] B. Adding the Organizations root ARN is too broad and may not be necessary.
-   [ ] D. Adding individual account ARNs is less efficient than using the OU ARN.
-   [ ] E. Recreating the KMS key is unnecessary and adds operational overhead.

Therefore, the combination of sharing AMI launch permissions with the development OU and granting the OU permission to use the KMS keys is the most appropriate solution.

A company has an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system that contains a reference dataset. The company has applications on Amazon EC2 instances that need to read the dataset. However, the applications must not be able to change the dataset. The company wants to use IAM access control to prevent the applications from being able to modify or delete the dataset. Which solution will meet these requirements?

-   [ ] A. Mount the EFS file system in read-only mode from within the EC2 instances.
-   [ ] B. Create a resource policy for the EFS file system that denies the elasticfilesystem:ClientWrite action to the IAM roles that are attached to the EC2 instances.
-   [ ] C. Create an identity policy for the EFS file system that denies the elasticfilesystem:ClientWrite action on the EFS file system.
-   [ ] D. Create an EFS access point for each application. Use Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) file permissions to allow read-only access to files in the root directory.

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] B. Create a resource policy for the EFS file system that denies the elasticfilesystem:ClientWrite action to the IAM roles that are attached to the EC2 instances.

Why these are the correct answers:

B.  Create a resource policy for the EFS file system that denies the elasticfilesystem:ClientWrite action to the IAM roles that are attached to the EC2 instances.

-   [ ] EFS resource policies control access to the EFS file system itself.
-   [ ] By denying the `elasticfilesystem:ClientWrite` action to the IAM roles used by the EC2 instances, you prevent those instances from writing to the file system.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. Mounting the EFS file system in read-only mode is a valid approach but is managed at the instance level, not centrally with IAM.
-   [ ] C. Identity policies are attached to IAM entities (users, groups, roles), not EFS file systems.
-   [ ] D. EFS access points and POSIX permissions control access at the file system level but do not use IAM to enforce restrictions.

Therefore, Option B is the most appropriate solution for using IAM to prevent applications from modifying the EFS dataset.

-   [ ] A. Create an IAM role in the company's account to delegate access to the vendor's IAM role. Attach the appropriate IAM policies to the role for the permissions that the vendor requires.

Why these are the correct answers:

A.  Create an IAM role in the company's account to delegate access to the vendor's IAM role. Attach the appropriate IAM policies to the role for the permissions that the vendor requires.

-   [ ] IAM roles enable secure cross-account access without sharing credentials.
-   [ ] The company's account creates a role that the vendor's IAM role can assume, granting temporary permissions.
-   [ ] This follows security best practices by using temporary credentials and avoiding long-term access keys.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] B. Creating an IAM user with a password shares long-term credentials, which is a security risk.
-   [ ] C. Adding a user from the vendor's account to a group in the company's account is less secure and harder to manage.
-   [ ] D. Permission boundaries do not provide cross-account access delegation.

Therefore, Option A is the most secure solution for granting vendor access to the company's AWS account.

A company wants to deploy an internal web application on AWS. The web application must be accessible only from the company's office. The company needs to download security patches for the web application from the internet. The company has created a VPC and has configured an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection to the company's office. A solutions architect must design a secure architecture for the web application. Which solution will meet these requirements?

-   [ ] A. Deploy the web application on Amazon EC2 instances in public subnets behind a public Application Load Balancer (ALB). Attach an internet gateway to the VPC. Set the inbound source of the ALB's security group to $0.0.0.0/0.$
-   [ ] B. Deploy the web application on Amazon EC2 instances in private subnets behind an internal Application Load Balancer (ALB). Deploy NAT gateways in public subnets. Attach an internet gateway to the VPC. Set the inbound source of the ALB's security group to the company's office network CIDR block.
-   [ ] C. Deploy the web application on Amazon EC2 instances in public subnets behind an internal Application Load Balancer (ALB). Deploy NAT gateways in private subnets. Attach an internet gateway to the VPSet the outbound destination of the ALB's security group to the company's office network CIDR block.
-   [ ] D. Deploy the web application on Amazon EC2 instances in private subnets behind a public Application Load Balancer (ALB). Attach an internet gateway to the VPC. Set the outbound destination of the ALB's security group to $0.0.0.0/0.$

  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] B. Deploy the web application on Amazon EC2 instances in private subnets behind an internal Application Load Balancer (ALB). Deploy NAT gateways in public subnets. Attach an internet gateway to the VPC. Set the inbound source of the ALB's security group to the company's office network CIDR block.

Why this is the correct answer:

-   [ ] Deploying EC2 instances in private subnets ensures they are not directly accessible from the internet, enhancing security.
-   [ ] An internal ALB distributes traffic within the VPC.
-   [ ] NAT gateways in public subnets allow the instances to download patches from the internet.
-   [ ] Restricting the ALB's security group to the company's CIDR block ensures access only from the office.
-   [ ] The Site-to-Site VPN provides the necessary connectivity between the office and the VPC.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. Public subnets and allowing access from 0.0.0.0/0 expose the application to the internet, which is insecure.
-   [ ] C. NAT gateways in private subnets are incorrect, as NAT gateways need to be in public subnets to route to the internet. The security group configuration is also incorrect.
-   [ ] D. A public ALB in front of private subnets doesn't align with the requirement for access only from the company's office. Allowing outbound access to 0.0.0.0/0 is also overly permissive for the ALB.

A company's marketing data is uploaded from multiple sources to an Amazon S3 bucket. A series of data preparation jobs aggregate the data for reporting. The data preparation jobs need to run at regular intervals in parallel. A few jobs need to run in a specific order later. The company wants to remove the operational overhead of job error handling, retry logic, and state management. Which solution will meet these requirements?

-   [ ] A. Use an AWS Lambda function to process the data as soon as the data is uploaded to the S3 bucket. Invoke other Lambda functions at regularly scheduled intervals.
-   [ ] B. Use Amazon Athena to process the data. Use Amazon EventBridge Scheduler to invoke Athena on a regular internal.
-   [ ] C. Use AWS Glue DataBrew to process the data. Use an AWS Step Functions state machine to run the DataBrew data preparation jobs.
-   [ ] D. Use AWS Data Pipeline to process the data. Schedule Data Pipeline to process the data once at midnight.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] C. Use AWS Glue DataBrew to process the data. Use an AWS Step Functions state machine to run the DataBrew data preparation jobs.

Why this is the correct answer:

-   [ ] AWS Glue DataBrew is a visual data preparation tool that makes it easy to clean and normalize data without writing code.
-   [ ] AWS Step Functions allows you to orchestrate multiple AWS services, including Glue DataBrew jobs, and handle parallel execution, job dependencies, error handling, retries, and state management.
-   [ ] This combination provides a managed, low-overhead solution for complex data preparation workflows.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. Using Lambda functions for data processing requires writing and managing code for each job, including error handling and retries. Scheduling Lambda functions does not provide built-in workflow orchestration.
-   [ ] B. Amazon Athena is a query service for analyzing data in S3 using SQL. It does not provide data preparation capabilities or built-in workflow orchestration. EventBridge Scheduler can trigger Athena queries but does not manage job dependencies or error handling.
-   [ ] D. AWS Data Pipeline is a workflow orchestration service, but it is an older service compared to Step Functions and requires more manual configuration and management. It is not as well-suited for the interactive data preparation that Glue DataBrew provides.

A solutions architect is designing a payment processing application that runs on AWS Lambda in private subnets across multiple Availability Zones. The application uses multiple Lambda functions and processes millions of transactions each day. The architecture must ensure that the application does not process duplicate payments. Which solution will meet these requirements?

-   [ ] A. Use Lambda to retrieve all due payments. Publish the due payments to an Amazon S3 bucket. Configure the S3 bucket with an event notification to invoke another Lambda function to process the due payments.
-   [ ] B. Use Lambda to retrieve all due payments. Publish the due payments to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure another Lambda function to poll the SQS queue and to process the due payments.
-   [ ] C. Use Lambda to retrieve all due payments. Publish the due payments to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue. Configure another Lambda function to poll the FIFO queue and to process the due payments.
-   [ ] D. Use Lambda to retrieve all due payments. Store the due payments in an Amazon DynamoDB table. Configure streams on the DynamoDB table to invoke another Lambda function to process the due payments.

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] C. Use Lambda to retrieve all due payments. Publish the due payments to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue. Configure another Lambda function to poll the FIFO queue and to process the due payments.

Why this is the correct answer:

-   [ ] Amazon SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues guarantee that messages are processed exactly once and in the order they are sent.
-   [ ] This eliminates the possibility of processing duplicate payments, which is critical for a payment processing application.
-   [ ] Using Lambda functions to send and process messages provides a scalable and serverless architecture.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. Using S3 for message queuing is inefficient and does not guarantee message ordering or exactly-once processing. S3 event notifications are not designed for reliable message queuing.
-   [ ] B. Standard SQS queues do not guarantee message ordering or exactly-once processing, which can lead to duplicate payment processing.
-   [ ] D. DynamoDB streams provide a near real-time, ordered stream of changes to a DynamoDB table, but they do not inherently guarantee exactly-once processing at the application level and add complexity compared to SQS FIFO.

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] C. Create an AWS Glue crawler to store and retrieve table metadata from the S3 bucket. Use Amazon Athena to run SQL statements directly on the data in the S3 bucket.

Why this is the correct answer:

-   [ ] AWS Glue crawler automatically infers the schema of the Parquet files in S3 and creates metadata tables.
-   [ ] Amazon Athena allows you to query data directly in S3 using SQL, without the need to load it into a database.
-   [ ] This is the most cost-effective solution because you only pay for the queries you run and the storage in S3.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. Creating an Aurora database and migrating the data is expensive and unnecessary for occasional analysis. It involves costs for the database instance, storage, and DMS.
-   [ ] B. Creating a Redshift cluster is also expensive, as you pay for the cluster even when not actively querying. Redshift is optimized for complex analytics, not occasional queries.
-   [ ] D. Creating an EMR cluster is costly and complex. EMR is designed for big data processing, not simple SQL queries on S3 data.

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] D. Create an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key. Enable encryption helpers on the Lambda functions to use the KMS key to store and encrypt the environment variables.

Why this is the correct answer:

-   [ ] AWS KMS allows you to encrypt sensitive data, including Lambda environment variables.
-   [ ] Lambda provides built-in support for KMS encryption, ensuring that environment variables are encrypted at rest and decrypted when the Lambda function is invoked.
-   [ ] This prevents developers from seeing the plaintext values.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. Deploying code to EC2 instances does not inherently solve the problem of securely managing environment variables and introduces more operational overhead.
-   [ ] B. Using AWS CloudHSM for Lambda environment variables is overly complex and expensive for this use case. CloudHSM is designed for dedicated hardware security modules, not for simple environment variable encryption.

-   [ ] A. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule that reacts when a user tries to delete a KMS key. Configure an AWS Config rule that cancels any deletion of a KMS key. Add the AWS Config rule as a target of the EventBridge rule. Create an SNS topic that notifies the administrators.
-   [ ] B. Create an AWS Lambda function that has custom logic to prevent KMS key deletion. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that is activated when a user tries to delete a KMS key. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule that invokes the Lambda function when the DeleteKey operation is performed. Create an SNS topic. Configure the EventBridge rule to publish an SNS message that notifies the administrators.
-   [ ] C. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule that reacts when the KMS DeleteKey operation is performed. Configure the rule to initiate an AWS Systems Manager Automation runbook. Configure the runbook to cancel the deletion of the KMS key. Create an SNS topic. Configure the EventBridge rule to publish an SNS message that notifies the administrators.
-   [ ] D. Create an AWS CloudTrail trail. Configure the trail to deliver logs to a new Amazon CloudWatch log group. Create a CloudWatch alarm based on the metric filter for the CloudWatch log group. Configure the alarm to use Amazon SNS to notify the administrators when the KMS DeleteKey operation is performed.

-   [ ] C. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule that reacts when the KMS DeleteKey operation is performed. Configure the rule to initiate an AWS Systems Manager Automation runbook. Configure the runbook to cancel the deletion of the KMS key. Create an SNS topic. Configure the EventBridge rule to publish an SNS message that notifies the administrators.

Why this is the correct answer:

-   [ ] Amazon EventBridge allows you to react to AWS API calls, including KMS key deletion attempts.
-   [ ] AWS Systems Manager Automation runbooks can automate actions in response to events, such as canceling the deletion of a KMS key.
-   [ ] Amazon SNS provides a simple way to send notifications, such as email alerts to administrators.
-   [ ] This solution provides a managed and automated way to prevent KMS key deletion and notify administrators.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. AWS Config rules are for evaluating the configuration of AWS resources, not for taking actions to prevent operations. It cannot "cancel" a KMS key deletion.
-   [ ] B. Using a Lambda function and CloudWatch alarm adds complexity and requires more custom code and management than using Systems Manager Automation.
-   [ ] D. CloudTrail and CloudWatch can monitor and log API calls, but they cannot prevent the deletion of a KMS key. They are primarily for auditing and monitoring, not for real-time intervention.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] B. Run the program in AWS Lambda. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule to run a Lambda function when reports are requested.

Why this is the correct answer:

-   [ ] AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers.
-   [ ] It is cost-effective because you only pay for the compute time you consume.
-   [ ] EventBridge can trigger Lambda functions in response to events or on a schedule, enabling on-demand report generation.
-   [ ] Lambda's scalability ensures that reports are generated quickly, even with a high volume of requests.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. EC2 On-Demand Instances are more expensive than Lambda for short-lived, infrequent tasks. Running instances continuously for a week is not cost-effective.
-   [ ] C. Amazon ECS is suitable for long-running applications or microservices, not for short, on-demand tasks like report generation. It also involves more overhead than Lambda.
-   [ ] D. EC2 Spot Instances can be cost-effective, but they can be interrupted, which is not suitable for reliable report generation. Running instances continuously for a week is also not cost-effective.

A company needs to create an AWS Lambda function that will run in a VPC in the company's primary AWS account. The Lambda function needs to access files that the company stores in an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. The EFS file system is located in a secondary AWS account. As the company adds files to the file system, the solution must scale to meet the demand. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

-   [ ] A.
    Create a new EFS file system in the primary account. Use AWS DataSync to copy the contents of the original EFS file system to the new EFS file system.
-   [ ] B.
    Create a VPC peering connection between the VPCs that are in the primary account and the secondary account.
-   [ ] C.
    Create a second Lambda function in the secondary account that has a mount that is configured for the file system. Use the primary account's Lambda function to invoke the secondary account's Lambda function.
-   [ ] D.
    Move the contents of the file system to a Lambda layer. Configure the Lambda layer's permissions to allow the company's secondary account to use the Lambda layer.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] B.
    Create a VPC peering connection between the VPCs that are in the primary account and the secondary account.

Why this is the correct answer:

-   [ ]
    A VPC peering connection allows you to connect two VPCs and enables resources in those VPCs to communicate with each other as if they are in the same network.
-   [ ]
    This would allow the Lambda function in the primary account to access the EFS file system in the secondary account directly.
-   [ ]
    VPC peering is generally cost-effective for accessing resources across accounts.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ]
    A. Creating a new EFS file system and copying data with DataSync adds complexity and cost for data transfer and storage. It is not the most cost-effective way to share an existing EFS file system.
-   [ ]
    C. Creating another Lambda function in the secondary account and invoking it from the primary account adds unnecessary complexity and overhead. It is less efficient than direct access via VPC peering.
-   [ ]
    D. Lambda layers are for packaging code and dependencies, not for sharing file systems. Moving the file system contents to a Lambda layer is not practical or cost-effective.
