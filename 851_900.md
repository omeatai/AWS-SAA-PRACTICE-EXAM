<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] C. Create an Amazon Aurora Serverless cluster. Develop an AWS Service Catalog product to launch databases in the cluster with the default capacity settings. Grant the developers access to the product.

Why these are the correct answers:

-   [ ] Aurora Serverless is designed for infrequent, intermittent, or unpredictable workloads, making it cost-effective for development databases that are only needed occasionally.
-   [ ] AWS Service Catalog allows the company to manage and distribute approved databases, enforcing standardization and governance.
-   [ ] This combination provides an efficient way to provision databases on demand and scales capacity automatically, minimizing costs when databases are not in use.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. While Aurora can be used, manually starting and stopping instances adds operational overhead and might not be as cost-effective as Aurora Serverless for highly variable usage patterns.
-   [ ] B. Using Service Catalog with regular Aurora instances doesnâ€™t address the cost-effectiveness for intermittent use as well as Aurora Serverless.
-   [ ] D. Monitoring idle RDS databases and terminating them is reactive and adds operational complexity. It is less efficient than using a solution that automatically scales based on demand.

<summary>Question 852</summary>

A company is building a web application that serves a content management system. The content management system runs on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The EC2 instances run in an Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. Users are constantly adding and updating files, blogs, and other website assets in the content management system. A solutions architect must implement a solution in which all the EC2 instances share up-to-date website content with the least possible lag time. Which solution meets these requirements?

-   [ ] A. Update the EC2 user data in the Auto Scaling group lifecycle policy to copy the website assets from the EC2 instance that was launched most recently. Configure the ALB to make changes to the website assets only in the newest EC2 instance.
-   [ ] B. Copy the website assets to an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. Configure each EC2 instance to mount the EFS file system locally. Configure the website hosting application to reference the website assets that are stored in the EFS file system.
-   [ ] C. Copy the website assets to an Amazon S3 bucket. Ensure that each EC2 instance downloads the website assets from the S3 bucket to the attached Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Run the S3 sync command once each hour to keep files up to date.
-   [ ] D. Restore an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshot with the website assets. Attach the EBS snapshot as a secondary EBS volume when a new EC2 instance is launched. Configure the website hosting application to reference the website assets that are stored in the secondary EBS volume.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] B. Copy the website assets to an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. Configure each EC2 instance to mount the EFS file system locally. Configure the website hosting application to reference the website assets that are stored in the EFS file system.

Why these are the correct answers:

-   [ ] Amazon EFS provides a scalable, shared file system that can be accessed by multiple EC2 instances simultaneously.
-   [ ] Mounting the EFS file system on each EC2 instance ensures that all instances have immediate access to the latest website assets.
-   [ ] This solution minimizes lag time for content updates, as changes are immediately available to all instances.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. Copying assets from the newest EC2 instance is complex to manage and introduces delays. Configuring the ALB to only update the newest instance is not a standard or efficient practice.
-   [ ] C. Downloading assets from S3 to EBS volumes on each instance is inefficient and introduces significant lag time, especially with hourly updates.
-   [ ] D. Using EBS snapshots for content sharing is not designed for frequent updates and introduces delays, as snapshots are point-in-time copies and attaching them as secondary volumes is cumbersome.

The company needs the ability to automatically detect and respond to suspicious or unexpected behavior in its AWS environment. The company already has added AWS WAF to its architecture. What should a solutions architect do next to protect against threats?

-   [ ] A. Use Amazon GuardDuty to perform threat detection. Configure Amazon EventBridge to filter for GuardDuty findings and to invoke an AWS Lambda function to adjust the AWS WAF rules.
-   [ ] B. Use AWS Firewall Manager to perform threat detection. Configure Amazon EventBridge to filter for Firewall Manager findings and to invoke an AWS Lambda function to adjust the AWS WAF web ACL.
-   [ ] C. Use Amazon Inspector to perform threat detection and to update the AWS WAF rules. Create a VPC network ACL to limit access to the web application.
-   [ ] D. Use Amazon Macie to perform threat detection and to update the AWS WAF rules. Create a VPC network ACL to limit access to the web application.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] A. Use Amazon GuardDuty to perform threat detection. Configure Amazon EventBridge to filter for GuardDuty findings and to invoke an AWS Lambda function to adjust the AWS WAF rules.

Why these are the correct answers:

-   [ ] Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that monitors for malicious activity and delivers security findings.
-   [ ] Amazon EventBridge can automate the response to GuardDuty findings by triggering AWS Lambda functions.
-   [ ] Using a Lambda function to adjust AWS WAF rules allows for automated mitigation of threats detected by GuardDuty.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] B. AWS Firewall Manager is a security management service that helps manage AWS WAF and other firewall rules across multiple accounts and applications, but it does not perform threat detection like GuardDuty.
-   [ ] C. Amazon Inspector is a vulnerability management service that scans for software vulnerabilities, not for runtime threat detection.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] C. Configure the DB cluster to use IAM database authentication. Create a database user to use with IAM authentication. Associate a role with the EC2 instances to allow applications on the instances to access the database.

Why these are the correct answers:

-   [ ] IAM database authentication allows EC2 instances to authenticate to the database using IAM roles, eliminating the need for static credentials.
-   [ ] This method simplifies credential management and enhances security by avoiding the storage and rotation of passwords.
-   [ ] Associating an IAM role with the EC2 instances is a straightforward way to grant database access with minimal operational overhead.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. Passing credentials through CloudFormation parameters involves managing and securing those parameters, which adds operational overhead.
-   [ ] B. Storing credentials in Parameter Store is more secure than passing them in CloudFormation, but it still requires managing and retrieving credentials, adding complexity.
-   [ ] D. Authenticating with an IAM user instead of a role is less flexible and scalable, and it doesn't follow the best practice of using roles for EC2 instances.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] C. Request an Amazon issued public certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the us-east-1 Region.

Why these are the correct answers:

-   [ ] AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) provides public SSL/TLS certificates for use with CloudFront at no cost.
-   [ ] ACM certificates used with CloudFront must be requested in the us-east-1 Region, regardless of where the CloudFront distribution is used.
-   [ ] Using a public certificate from ACM allows the company to use a custom domain name with CloudFront without additional certificate costs.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. Private certificates are used for internal resources and are not suitable for public CloudFront distributions.
-   [ ] B. Private certificates are not appropriate for public-facing CloudFront distributions. Also, ACM certificates for CloudFront must be in the us-east-1 Region, not us-west-1.
-   [ ] D. Although public certificates are correct, they must be requested in the us-east-1 Region, not us-west-1.

A company creates operations data and stores the data in an Amazon S3 bucket. For the company's annual audit, an external consultant needs to access an annual report that is stored in the S3 bucket. The external consultant needs to access the report for 7 days. The company must implement a solution to allow the external consultant access to only the report. Which solution will meet these requirements with the MOST operational efficiency?

-   [ ] A. Create a new S3 bucket that is configured to host a public static website. Migrate the operations data to the new S3 bucket. Share the S3 website URL with the external consultant.
-   [ ] B. Enable public access to the S3 bucket for 7 days. Remove access to the S3 bucket when the external consultant completes the audit.
-   [ ] C. Create a new IAM user that has access to the report in the S3 bucket. Provide the access keys to the external consultant. Revoke the access keys after 7 days.
-   [ ] D. Generate a presigned URL that has the required access to the location of the report on the S3 bucket. Share the presigned URL with the external consultant.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] D. Generate a presigned URL that has the required access to the location of the report on the S3 bucket. Share the presigned URL with the external consultant.

Why these are the correct answers:

-   [ ] Presigned URLs allow you to grant temporary access to specific S3 objects.
-   [ ] This solution provides secure, time-limited access to the report without requiring the consultant to have AWS credentials.
-   [ ] It is operationally efficient because it avoids creating new buckets, modifying bucket permissions, or managing IAM users for temporary access.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. Creating a new public S3 website and migrating data is inefficient and exposes all data, not just the report.
-   [ ] B. Enabling public access to the entire bucket is a security risk and grants more access than necessary.
-   [ ] C. Creating an IAM user and sharing access keys is less secure and requires more overhead in terms of credential management and revocation.

A company has deployed a multi-account strategy on AWS by using AWS Control Tower. The company has provided individual AWS accounts to each of its developers. The company wants to implement controls to limit AWS resource costs that the developers incur. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

-   [ ]   A.  Instruct each developer to tag all their resources with a tag that has a key of CostCenter and a value of the developer's name. Use the required-tags AWS Config managed rule to check for the tag. Create an AWS Lambda function to terminate resources that do not have the tag. Configure AWS Cost Explorer to send a daily report to each developer to monitor their spending.
-   [ ]   B.  Use AWS Budgets to establish budgets for each developer account. Set up budget alerts for actual and forecast values to notify developers when they exceed or expect to exceed their assigned budget. Use AWS Budgets actions to apply a DenyAll policy to the developer's IAM role to prevent additional resources from being launched when the assigned budget is reached.
-   [ ]   C.  Use AWS Cost Explorer to monitor and report on costs for each developer account. Configure Cost Explorer to send a daily report to each developer to monitor their spending. Use AWS Cost Anomaly Detection to detect anomalous spending and provide alerts.
-   [ ]   D.  Use AWS Service Catalog to allow developers to launch resources within a limited cost range. Create AWS Lambda functions in each AWS account to stop running resources at the end of each work day. Configure the Lambda functions to resume the resources at the start of each work day.

A company runs its critical storage application in the AWS Cloud.
 The application uses Amazon S3 in two AWS Regions.
 The company wants the application to send remote user data to the nearest S3 bucket with no public network congestion.
 The company also wants the application to fail over with the least amount of management of Amazon S3.
 Which solution will meet these requirements?

A.
 Implement an active-active design between the two Regions.
 Configure the application to use the regional S3 endpoints closest to the user.
 B.
 Use an active-passive configuration with S3 Multi-Region Access Points.
 Create a global endpoint for each of the Regions.
 C.
 Send user data to the regional S3 endpoints closest to the user.
 Configure an S3 cross-account replication rule to keep the S3 buckets synchronized.
 D.
 Set up Amazon S3 to use Multi-Region Access Points in an active-active configuration with a single global endpoint.
 Configure S3 Cross-Region Replication.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

D.
 Set up Amazon S3 to use Multi-Region Access Points in an active-active configuration with a single global endpoint.
 Configure S3 Cross-Region Replication.

Why these are the correct answers:

-   [ ]   S3 Multi-Region Access Points provide a single global endpoint for accessing data in multiple S3 buckets across different AWS Regions.
-   [ ]   This simplifies application logic by abstracting away the need to manage regional endpoints.
-   [ ]   S3 Cross-Region Replication ensures data is copied between buckets, supporting failover scenarios.
-   [ ]   This combination allows the application to write to the closest bucket while maintaining data redundancy and failover capabilities.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ]   A.  While using regional endpoints can reduce latency, it requires the application to manage which endpoint to use and doesn't provide automated failover.
-   [ ]   B.  Active-passive configurations introduce complexity in failover management, and creating multiple global endpoints is not the standard use case for Multi-Region Access Points.
-   [ ]   C.  Replication alone does not provide a single endpoint for the application to use and requires application logic to determine the closest bucket.

<summary>Answer</summary>

B.
 Convert the Aurora cluster to an Aurora global database.
 Configure managed failover.

Why these are the correct answers:

-   [ ]   Aurora Global Database is designed for disaster recovery, providing fast failover across AWS Regions.
-   [ ]   It offers RPO in seconds and RTO typically less than one minute.
-   [ ]   Managed failover automates the failover process, minimizing operational overhead.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ]   A.  Read replicas are for scaling reads, not for fast automated failover.
-   [ ]   C.  Cross-Region Replication requires more manual steps for failover and doesn't offer the same RPO/RTO as Global Database.
-   [ ]   D.  AWS DMS is for database migration, not for DR, and it doesn't meet the RPO/RTO requirements.

A company is migrating five on-premises applications to VPCs in the AWS Cloud.
 Each application is currently deployed in isolated virtual networks on premises and should be deployed similarly in the AWS Cloud.
 The applications need to reach a shared services VPC.
 All the applications must be able to communicate with each other.
 If the migration is successful, the company will repeat the migration process for more than 100 applications.
 Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST administrative overhead?
 A.
 Deploy software VPN tunnels between the application VPCs and the shared services VPC.
 Add routes between the application VPCs in their subnets to the shared services VPC.
 B.
 Deploy VPC peering connections between the application VPCs and the shared services VPC.
 Add routes between the application VPCs in their subnets to the shared services VPC through the peering connection.
 C.
 Deploy an AWS Direct Connect connection between the application VPCs and the shared services VPAdd routes from the application VPCs in their subnets to the shared services VPC and the applications VPCs.
 Add routes from the shared services VPC subnets to the applications VPCs.
 D.
 Deploy a transit gateway with associations between the transit gateway and the application VPCs and the shared services VPC.
 Add routes between the application VPCs in their subnets and the application VPCs to the shared services VPC through the transit gateway.
