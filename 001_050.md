  <summary>Question 1</summary>

A company collects data for temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure in cities across multiple continents.  The average volume of data that the company collects from each site daily is 500 GB.  Each site has a high-speed Internet connection.    

The company wants to aggregate the data from all these global sites as quickly as possible in a single Amazon S3 bucket.  The solution must minimize operational complexity.    

Which solution meets these requirements?

- [ ]  A. Turn on S3 Transfer Acceleration on the destination S3 bucket.  Use multipart uploads to directly upload site data to the destination S3 bucket. 
- [ ]  B. Upload the data from each site to an S3 bucket in the closest Region.  Use S3 Cross-Region Replication to copy objects to the destination S3 bucket.  Then remove the data from the origin S3 bucket. 
- [ ]  C. Schedule AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device jobs daily to transfer data from each site to the closest Region.  Use S3 Cross-Region Replication to copy objects to the destination S3 bucket. 
- [ ]  D. Upload the data from each site to an Amazon EC2 instance in the closest Region.  Store the data in an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume.  At regular intervals, take an EBS snapshot and copy it to the Region that contains the destination S3 bucket.  Restore the EBS volume in that Region. 

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ]  A. Turn on S3 Transfer Acceleration on the destination S3 bucket.  Use multipart uploads to directly upload site data to the destination S3 bucket. 

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ]  S3 Transfer Acceleration: This feature leverages Amazon CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations. When data arrives at an edge location, it is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path. This is ideal for transferring large amounts of data over long distances, as is the case with global sites, and helps in aggregating data "as quickly as possible".    
- [ ]  Multipart Uploads: For large files like 500 GB daily from each site, multipart upload allows you to upload a single object as a set of parts.  This can lead to faster uploads by uploading parts in parallel and increased resilience, as a failed part can be retransmitted without affecting other parts.    
- [ ]  Minimized Operational Complexity: This solution involves configuring Transfer Acceleration on the destination bucket and using the AWS SDK or CLI (which support multipart uploads) to upload directly.  This is a straightforward approach with minimal moving parts compared to the other options, meeting the requirement to "minimize operational complexity".    

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ]  Option B is wrong because: While using S3 Cross-Region Replication works, uploading to a local bucket first and then replicating introduces an additional step and latency compared to a direct, accelerated transfer.  Managing data in multiple S3 buckets (origin and destination) and then ensuring deletion from the origin also adds to operational overhead.    
- [ ]  Option C is wrong because: AWS Snowball Edge is typically suited for situations where network connectivity is limited or for petabyte-scale data transfers where online transfer would be too slow.  Given that each site has a high-speed internet connection and daily transfers of 500GB, the logistics of ordering, receiving, managing, and shipping Snowball devices daily from multiple global sites would be highly operationally complex and slow, contradicting the requirements.    
- [ ]  Option D is wrong because: This solution introduces significant operational overhead by involving EC2 instances, EBS volumes, EBS snapshots, snapshot copying, and volume restoration.  This is a multi-step, complex process for a task that can be achieved much more simply and directly with S3 features, and it does not align with the requirement for the least operational overhead.

  <summary>Question 2</summary>

A company needs the ability to analyze the log files of its proprietary application. The logs are stored in JSON format in an Amazon S3 bucket. Queries will be simple and will run on-demand. A solutions architect needs to perform the analysis with minimal changes to the existing architecture.

What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?

- [ ] A. Use Amazon Redshift to load all the content into one place and run the SQL queries as needed.
- [ ] B. Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to store the logs. Run SQL queries as needed from the Amazon CloudWatch console.
- [ ] C. Use Amazon Athena directly with Amazon S3 to run the queries as needed.
- [ ] D. Use AWS Glue to catalog the logs. Use a transient Apache Spark cluster on Amazon EMR to run the SQL queries as needed.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] C. Use Amazon Athena directly with Amazon S3 to run the queries as needed.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Amazon Athena is a serverless query service that allows you to analyze data directly in Amazon S3 using standard SQL.
- [ ] Since the logs are already stored in JSON format in an S3 bucket, Athena can query this data in place.
- [ ] This perfectly aligns with the requirement for "minimal changes to the existing architecture" and "LEAST amount of operational overhead"  because there's no need to move data or manage any servers or clusters.
- [ ] Athena is well-suited for "simple" and "on-demand" queries.   

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Amazon Redshift is a powerful data warehousing service, but it requires loading data from S3 into Redshift clusters. This process involves setting up a Redshift cluster, defining schemas, and managing the data loading process (ETL), which introduces significant operational overhead and changes to the architecture, contradicting the requirements.   
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: While Amazon CloudWatch Logs can store and query logs, the scenario states the logs are already in an Amazon S3 bucket. Moving them to CloudWatch Logs would be an unnecessary step, adding complexity and operational overhead. CloudWatch Logs Insights is useful for operational logs generated by AWS services or applications sending logs directly to it, but for analyzing existing JSON files in S3, Athena is more direct and efficient.   
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Using AWS Glue to catalog the logs and then running SQL queries with a transient Apache Spark cluster on Amazon EMR is a viable but more complex solution. It introduces more operational overhead (setting up Glue crawlers, configuring and managing EMR clusters, even if transient) compared to the serverless nature of Athena, especially for "simple and will run on-demand" queries. This option is more powerful than needed for the described scenario and doesn't meet the "LEAST amount of operational overhead" requirement as effectively as Athena.

  <summary>Question 3</summary>
   
A company uses AWS Organizations to manage multiple AWS accounts for different departments. The management account has an Amazon S3 bucket that contains project reports. The company wants to limit access to this S3 bucket to only users of accounts within the organization in AWS Organizations.

Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?

- [ ] A. Add the aws:PrincipalOrgID global condition key with a reference to the organization ID to the S3 bucket policy.
- [ ] B. Create an organizational unit (OU) for each department. Add the aws:PrincipalOrgPaths global condition key to the S3 bucket policy.
- [ ] C. Use AWS CloudTrail to monitor the CreateAccount, InviteAccountToOrganization, LeaveOrganization, and RemoveAccountFromOrganization events. Update the S3 bucket policy accordingly.
- [ ] D. Tag each user that needs access to the S3 bucket. Add the aws:PrincipalTag global condition key to the S3 bucket policy.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] A. Add the aws:PrincipalOrgID global condition key with a reference to the organization ID to the S3 bucket policy.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] The aws:PrincipalOrgID global condition key is specifically designed for this use case.
- [ ] By adding this condition to the S3 bucket policy and specifying your AWS Organizations ID, you can restrict access to IAM principals (users and roles) that belong to any account within that organization.
- [ ] This is the most direct and simple method to achieve the stated goal, thus ensuring the "LEAST amount of operational overhead" as it requires a one-time policy configuration that dynamically applies to all accounts in the organization.   

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option B is wrong because: While aws:PrincipalOrgPaths allows you to grant permissions based on an account's membership in an Organizational Unit (OU) within AWS Organizations, it's more granular than required.  The requirement is to limit access to any user from any account within the organization, not specific OUs.  Using aws:PrincipalOrgID is simpler for this organization-wide access. Managing access via OUs for this purpose would add unnecessary complexity if the goal isn't to differentiate access by department/OU.   
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Using AWS CloudTrail to monitor organization membership changes and then dynamically updating the S3 bucket policy is a highly complex and operationally burdensome solution.  It would require developing and maintaining automation (e.g., Lambda functions triggered by CloudTrail events) to parse logs and modify policies. This is far from the "LEAST amount of operational overhead."   
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Using aws:PrincipalTag to control access based on tags applied to IAM users or roles would require a comprehensive tagging strategy and consistent application of these tags to all relevant principals across all accounts in the organization.  While a valid approach for attribute-based access control, it involves more setup and ongoing management (ensuring all users/roles are correctly tagged) compared to the simpler organization-wide condition offered by aws:PrincipalOrgID.

  <summary>Question 4</summary>

An application runs on an Amazon EC2 instance in a VPC. The application processes logs that are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. The EC2 instance needs to access the S3 bucket without connectivity to the internet.

Which solution will provide private network connectivity to Amazon S3?

- [ ] A. Create a gateway VPC endpoint to the S3 bucket.
- [ ] B. Stream the logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Export the logs to the S3 bucket.
- [ ] C. Create an instance profile on Amazon EC2 to allow S3 access.
- [ ] D. Create an Amazon API Gateway API with a private link to access the S3 endpoint.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] A. Create a gateway VPC endpoint to the S3 bucket.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Gateway VPC Endpoint for S3: This is the specific AWS service designed to allow resources within your VPC (like EC2 instances) to access Amazon S3 (and DynamoDB) without needing an Internet Gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection.
- [ ] Traffic between your VPC and S3 does not leave the Amazon network. This directly meets the requirement for the EC2 instance to access S3 "without connectivity to the internet."   

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option B is wrong because: This describes a data flow pattern into S3 via CloudWatch Logs, not how an EC2 instance accesses data from S3 for processing. It doesn't address the private network connectivity requirement for the EC2 instance that is processing logs already in S3. Moreover, sending logs to CloudWatch Logs might itself require internet access if a VPC endpoint for CloudWatch Logs isn't also configured.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: An instance profile (which contains an IAM role) grants the EC2 instance permissions (authorization) to access S3. While necessary for the application to interact with S3, it does not provide the network path. The question is specifically about "private network connectivity." An instance profile is about "what" the EC2 instance can do, not "how" it connects from a network perspective.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Using Amazon API Gateway to front S3 and then accessing that API via AWS PrivateLink is an overly complex solution for this specific problem. While technically possible to achieve private connectivity this way, a gateway VPC endpoint for S3 is a much simpler, more direct, and standard solution designed for EC2-to-S3 private communication within a VPC. API Gateway is generally used for building and exposing APIs to clients, not typically for backend instance-to-service private access when a direct VPC endpoint is available.

  <summary>Question 5</summary>
   
A company is hosting a web application on AWS using a single Amazon EC2 instance that stores user-uploaded documents in an Amazon EBS volume. For better scalability and availability, the company duplicated the architecture and created a second EC2 instance and EBS volume in another Availability Zone, placing both behind an Application Load Balancer. After completing this change, users reported that, each time they refreshed the website, they could see one subset of their documents or the other, but never all of the documents at the same time.

What should a solutions architect propose to ensure users see all of their documents at once?

- [ ] A. Copy the data so both EBS volumes contain all the documents
- [ ] B. Configure the Application Load Balancer to direct a user to the server with the documents
- [ ] C. Copy the data from both EBS volumes to Amazon EFS. Modify the application to save new documents to Amazon EFS
- [ ] D. Configure the Application Load Balancer to send the request to both servers. Return each document from the correct server

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] C. Copy the data from both EBS volumes to Amazon EFS. Modify the application to save new documents to Amazon EFS

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] The core issue is that each EC2 instance has its own separate EBS volume, meaning user documents are isolated to the instance they were uploaded to or are stored on. When the Application Load Balancer sends a user to a different instance on refresh, they see a different set of documents.
- [ ] Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) provides scalable, shared file storage that can be accessed concurrently by multiple EC2 instances, even across different Availability Zones within the same region.
- [ ] By migrating the documents to Amazon EFS and modifying the application to read from and write to this shared EFS file system, both EC2 instances will access the same central repository of documents.
- [ ] This ensures that users see all their documents consistently, regardless of which EC2 instance serves their request. This solution directly addresses the problem of data inconsistency across instances.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Manually or programmatically copying data between two EBS volumes to keep them synchronized is operationally complex, error-prone, and can lead to data inconsistencies, especially with active uploads. It's not a scalable or reliable solution for ensuring all users see all documents in real-time.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: While an Application Load Balancer can use features like sticky sessions to send a user to the same instance, this doesn't solve the underlying problem. If a user's documents are meant to be accessible globally (e.g., new documents uploaded could theoretically land on either instance, or if an instance fails), sticky sessions won't ensure all documents are visible. The fundamental issue is the lack of a shared data store.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Configuring an Application Load Balancer to send requests to both servers and then have the application logic aggregate responses is not a standard or efficient way to handle shared file access. This would add significant complexity to the application and the infrastructure, and it doesn't solve the problem of where new documents are stored or how they are consistently accessed.

A company uses NFS to store large video files in on-premises network attached storage. Each video file ranges in size from 1 MB to 500 GB. The total storage is 70 TB and is no longer growing. The company decides to migrate the video files to Amazon S3. The company must migrate the video files as soon as possible while using the least possible network bandwidth.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Create an S3 bucket. Create an IAM role that has permissions to write to the S3 bucket. Use the AWS CLI to copy all files locally to the S3 bucket.
- [ ] B. Create an AWS Snowball Edge job. Receive a Snowball Edge device on premises. Use the Snowball Edge client to transfer data to the device. Return the device so that AWS can import the data into Amazon S3.
- [ ] C. Deploy an S3 File Gateway on premises. Create a public service endpoint to connect to the S3 File Gateway. Create an S3 bucket. Create a new NFS file share on the S3 File Gateway. Point the new file share to the S3 bucket. Transfer the data from the existing NFS file share to the S3 File Gateway.
- [ ] D. Set up an AWS Direct Connect connection between the on-premises network and AWS. Deploy an S3 File Gateway on premises. Create a public virtual interface (VIF) to connect to the S3 File Gateway. Create an S3 bucket. Create a new NFS file share on the S3 File Gateway. Point the new file share to the S3 bucket. Transfer the data from the existing NFS file share to the S3 File Gateway.

  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] B. Create an AWS Snowball Edge job. Receive a Snowball Edge device on premises. Use the Snowball Edge client to transfer data to the device. Return the device so that AWS can import the data into Amazon S3.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] AWS Snowball Edge is specifically designed for transferring large amounts of data (like 70 TB) into AWS when network bandwidth is a constraint or when the transfer needs to be done quickly without saturating the internet connection.
- [ ] "Least possible network bandwidth": Snowball Edge allows data to be copied to a physical device on-premises and then shipped to AWS. The actual data transfer to AWS occurs over AWS's internal network after they receive the device, not over your company's internet connection. This minimizes the use of your network bandwidth for the large data volume.
- [ ] "As soon as possible": For 70 TB of data, physical transfer via Snowball Edge (including shipping time) is often faster than transferring over a typical internet connection. Data can be loaded onto the device at local network speeds.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Transferring 70 TB of data using the AWS CLI over a standard internet connection would consume a massive amount of network bandwidth and would likely take a very long time, depending on the available upload speed. This contradicts both "least possible network bandwidth" and "as soon as possible."
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: While an S3 File Gateway provides an NFS interface and can help migrate data to S3, it would still transfer the 70 TB of data over your existing internet connection (unless combined with Direct Connect). This doesn't address the "least possible network bandwidth" requirement as effectively as an offline transfer method like Snowball for the initial bulk migration.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Setting up an AWS Direct Connect connection can be a lengthy and expensive process, especially if it's not already in place. While it provides dedicated bandwidth, Snowball Edge is generally a faster and more cost-effective solution for a one-time large-scale data migration when minimizing the use of existing network bandwidth is key. The requirement is "least possible network bandwidth," implying avoiding saturating the existing connection, which Snowball achieves by taking the primary data transfer offline.

  <summary>Question 7</summary>
  
A company has an application that ingests incoming messages. Dozens of other applications and microservices then quickly consume these messages. The number of messages varies drastically and sometimes increases suddenly to 100,000 each second. The company wants to decouple the solution and increase scalability.

Which solution meets these requirements?

- [ ] A. Persist the messages to Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics. Configure the consumer applications to read and process the messages.
- [ ] B. Deploy the ingestion application on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group to scale the number of EC2 instances based on CPU metrics.
- [ ] C. Write the messages to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams with a single shard. Use an AWS Lambda function to preprocess messages and store them in Amazon DynamoDB. Configure the consumer applications to read from DynamoDB to process the messages.
- [ ] D. Publish the messages to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) subscriptions. Configure the consumer applications to process the messages from the queues.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] D. Publish the messages to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) subscriptions. Configure the consumer applications to process the messages from the queues.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Decoupling: Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) allows you to publish messages to a topic. Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) queues can then subscribe to this SNS topic. This creates a fan-out architecture where the message-producing application is decoupled from the numerous consuming applications. Each consuming application processes messages from its own SQS queue.
- [ ] Scalability for many consumers: An SNS topic can deliver messages to many SQS queues (and other subscribers like Lambda, HTTP endpoints, etc.). This allows "dozens of other applications and microservices" to consume the messages independently and scale their processing as needed. SQS queues can buffer a large number of messages, accommodating the "100,000 each second" requirement (though this might require using SQS FIFO queues with high throughput mode or multiple standard queues depending on ordering and exact-once processing needs, the pattern itself is sound).
- [ ] Handling drastic variations: SQS queues act as durable buffers. If there's a sudden spike in messages, the queues will hold them until the consumer applications can process them. This ensures messages are not lost and consumers can work at their own pace, addressing the "varies drastically" aspect.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics is designed for real-time analysis and processing of streaming data (e.g., running SQL queries or Apache Flink applications on data streams). It's not primarily a message bus for distributing messages to dozens of diverse consumer applications for general processing. Consumers typically read from a data stream (like Kinesis Data Streams) or a persistent store, not directly from Kinesis Data Analytics in the way described.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: While scaling the ingestion application with an Auto Scaling group is a good practice for handling variable load on the producer side, it does not address the requirement of decoupling and providing a scalable consumption mechanism for the "dozens of other applications and microservices." This option only solves part of the problem.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: A single shard in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams has ingestion limits (typically 1 MB/second or 1,000 records/second). 100,000 messages per second would far exceed the capacity of a single shard, making this option unfeasible for the described load. While Kinesis Data Streams is highly scalable by adding more shards, the specification of a "single shard" makes this choice incorrect. Furthermore, while storing preprocessed messages in DynamoDB for consumption is possible, SNS/SQS provides a more robust and flexible pub/sub and queuing mechanism for a large number of independent consumers.

  <summary>Question 8</summary>
  
A company is migrating a distributed application to AWS. The application serves variable workloads. The legacy platform consists of a primary server that coordinates jobs across multiple compute nodes. The company wants to modernize the application with a solution that maximizes resiliency and scalability.

How should a solutions architect design the architecture to meet these requirements?

- [ ]  A. Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as a destination for the jobs. Implement the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances that are managed in an Auto Scaling group. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling to use scheduled scaling.
- [ ]  B. Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as a destination for the jobs. Implement the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances that are managed in an Auto Scaling group. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling based on the size of the queue.
- [ ]  C. Implement the primary server and the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances that are managed in an Auto Scaling group. Configure AWS CloudTrail as a destination for the jobs. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling based on the load on the primary server.
- [ ]  D. Implement the primary server and the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances that are managed in an Auto Scaling group. Configure Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) as a destination for the jobs. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling based on the load on the compute nodes.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ]  B. Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as a destination for the jobs. Implement the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances that are managed in an Auto Scaling group. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling based on the size of the queue.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ]  Decoupling with SQS: Using Amazon SQS as a destination for jobs effectively decouples the job producers from the consumers (compute nodes). This is a core principle for building resilient and scalable distributed applications. If compute nodes fail, the jobs remain safely in the SQS queue. This replaces the legacy "primary server that coordinates jobs" with a more robust, managed service.
- [ ]  Scalable Compute with Auto Scaling: Implementing compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group allows the application to automatically adjust the number of compute instances based on the workload.
- [ ]  Dynamic Scaling based on Queue Size: Configuring EC2 Auto Scaling to scale based on the size of the SQS queue (e.g., the ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible metric) is a highly effective method for handling "variable workloads." As the number of jobs in the queue increases, the Auto Scaling group launches more instances to process them. As the queue shortens, instances are terminated to save costs. This directly ties compute capacity to the actual pending workload, maximizing both resiliency and scalability.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ]  Option A is wrong because: Scheduled scaling is suitable for predictable workloads with known patterns. The problem states "variable workloads," which implies unpredictability. Scaling based on queue size (as in option B) is much more responsive to dynamic, variable demand than fixed scheduled scaling.
- [ ]  Option C is wrong because: AWS CloudTrail is a service for logging API calls and account activity for auditing and governance; it is not a "destination for jobs" or a message queuing system. Furthermore, scaling compute nodes based on the load of a single "primary server" can perpetuate a single point of bottleneck or failure, which modernizing seeks to avoid.
- [ ]  Option D is wrong because: Amazon EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events) is an event bus service used to build event-driven architectures by routing events between different services. While it can trigger compute resources, SQS is more specifically designed as a durable queue for decoupling tasks and managing a backlog of jobs for worker processes. Scaling based on the load on compute nodes is a valid approach, but scaling based on the SQS queue depth provides a more direct measure of the unprocessed workload.

  <summary>Question 9</summary>

A company is running an SMB file server in its data center. The file server stores large files that are accessed frequently for the first few days after the files are created. After 7 days the files are rarely accessed.

The total data size is increasing and is close to the company's total storage capacity. A solutions architect must increase the company's available storage space without losing low-latency access to the most recently accessed files. The solutions architect must also provide file lifecycle management to avoid future storage issues.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

- [ ]  A. Use AWS DataSync to copy data that is older than 7 days from the SMB file server to AWS.
- [ ]  B. Create an Amazon S3 File Gateway to extend the company's storage space. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 7 days.
- [ ]  C. Create an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system to extend the company's storage space.
- [ ]  D. Install a utility on each user's computer to access Amazon S3. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 7 days.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ]  B. Create an Amazon S3 File Gateway to extend the company's storage space. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 7 days.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ]  Extending storage and low-latency access: Amazon S3 File Gateway (part of AWS Storage Gateway) provides a file interface (SMB or NFS) into Amazon S3. It stores data in S3 while caching frequently accessed data locally on the gateway appliance. This allows users to continue accessing files via SMB with low latency for the cached, recently accessed files (frequently accessed for the first few days). The bulk of the storage resides in S3, effectively increasing the company's available storage space.
- [ ]  File lifecycle management: Once the files are in Amazon S3 (via the File Gateway), you can apply S3 Lifecycle policies. These policies can automatically transition objects to different storage classes based on their age. Transitioning files older than 7 days (which are rarely accessed) to a very cost-effective archival tier like S3 Glacier Deep Archive directly addresses the requirement for lifecycle management and helps avoid future storage capacity issues by moving cold data to cheaper storage.
- [ ]  Minimal disruption: Users can continue to access files using the SMB protocol through the File Gateway, minimizing changes to their existing workflows.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ]  Option A is wrong because: AWS DataSync is a service for online data transfer, useful for migrating data or synchronizing it between on-premises systems and AWS. While it could copy older data to AWS, it doesn't provide the seamless storage extension with local caching for low-latency access to recent files that a File Gateway offers. Users would still be interacting with the capacity-constrained on-premises server for all files unless their access patterns were changed.
- [ ]  Option C is wrong because: While Amazon FSx for Windows File Server provides fully managed SMB file storage and could extend the company's storage space, this option by itself doesn't explicitly address the lifecycle management to a very cold, cost-effective archive tier like S3 Glacier Deep Archive for files older than 7 days. S3 File Gateway combined with S3 Lifecycle policies to S3 Glacier Deep Archive is typically more cost-effective for very cold, rarely accessed data compared to keeping it all within FSx tiers long-term.
- [ ]  Option D is wrong because: Requiring users to install a utility on their computers to access Amazon S3 directly would be a significant change from their current SMB file server access method and could be disruptive. It also bypasses the benefits of a local cache for frequently accessed files that a File Gateway provides, potentially increasing latency for those files. While S3 Lifecycle policies could be used, the access method is not ideal for maintaining low-latency access for recent files in an existing SMB setup.

A company is building an ecommerce web application on AWS. The application sends information about new orders to an Amazon API Gateway REST API to process. The company wants to ensure that orders are processed in the order that they are received.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

- [ ]  A. Use an API Gateway integration to publish a message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the application receives an order. Subscribe an AWS Lambda function to the topic to perform processing.
- [ ]  B. Use an API Gateway integration to send a message to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue when the application receives an order. Configure the SQS FIFO queue to invoke an AWS Lambda function for processing.
- [ ]  C. Use an API Gateway authorizer to block any requests while the application processes an order.
- [ ]  D. Use an API Gateway integration to send a message to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue when the application receives an order. Configure the SQS standard queue to invoke an AWS Lambda function for processing.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ]  B. Use an API Gateway integration to send a message to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue when the application receives an order. Configure the SQS FIFO queue to invoke an AWS Lambda function for processing.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Guaranteed Order Processing with SQS FIFO: The core requirement is to process orders "in the order that they are received." Amazon SQS FIFO (First-In, First-Out) queues are specifically designed for use cases where the order of operations and events is critical. They preserve the exact order in which messages are sent and received.
- [ ] Decoupling and Asynchronous Processing: When API Gateway receives an order, it can send it as a message to an SQS FIFO queue. This decouples the initial API request from the backend processing. An AWS Lambda function can then be configured to poll this SQS FIFO queue and process the orders one by one, in the correct sequence. This architecture is also scalable and resilient.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Amazon SNS is a publish/subscribe service. While it's excellent for fanning out messages to multiple subscribers, it does not guarantee the order in which subscribers (like a Lambda function) receive or process messages. For strict order preservation, SNS alone is not suitable.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Using an API Gateway authorizer to block incoming requests while an order is being processed would effectively make the system process only one order at a time globally. This would severely impact the application's performance, scalability, and availability, especially for an ecommerce application that might receive many concurrent orders. Authorizers are intended for controlling access (authentication and authorization), not for managing processing flow in this manner.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Amazon SQS standard queues offer "best-effort" ordering, meaning that while messages are generally delivered in the order they are sent, there's no guarantee. For critical tasks like processing ecommerce orders in sequence, where mistakes in ordering can have significant consequences, standard SQS queues are not appropriate. SQS FIFO queues are the correct choice for guaranteed ordering.

A company has an application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances and uses an Amazon Aurora database. The EC2 instances connect to the database by using user names and passwords that are stored locally in a file. The company wants to minimize the operational overhead of credential management.

What should a solutions architect do to accomplish this goal?

- [ ] A. Use AWS Secrets Manager. Turn on automatic rotation.
- [ ] B. Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Turn on automatic rotation.
- [ ] C. Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store objects that are encrypted with an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) encryption key. Migrate the credential file to the S3 bucket. Point the application to the S3 bucket.
- [ ] D. Create an encrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume for each EC2 instance. Attach the new EBS volume to each EC2 instance. Migrate the credential file to the new EBS volume. Point the application to the new EBS volume.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] A. Use AWS Secrets Manager. Turn on automatic rotation.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] AWS Secrets Manager is a service specifically designed for managing the lifecycle of secrets, including database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive data.
- [ ] Automatic Rotation: A key feature of Secrets Manager is its ability to automatically rotate secrets for supported AWS services like Amazon Aurora. This eliminates the manual effort and potential errors associated with rotating credentials, directly addressing the requirement to "minimize the operational overhead of credential management."
- [ ] Secure Storage and Retrieval: Secrets are stored securely, encrypted at rest, and applications can retrieve them programmatically using IAM permissions, removing the need to store credentials in local files on EC2 instances.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option B is wrong because: While AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store can store secrets (as SecureString parameters) and has some versioning capabilities, its native automatic rotation features are not as extensive or straightforward for database credentials like Amazon Aurora when compared to AWS Secrets Manager. Secrets Manager is the more specialized and feature-rich service for managing and automatically rotating database credentials. Parameter Store often requires custom Lambda functions for complex rotation scenarios, which adds operational overhead.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Storing credential files in Amazon S3, even with encryption, is not a best practice for managing active database credentials. This approach lacks built-in automatic rotation capabilities, which is crucial for minimizing operational overhead. The application would still need to fetch and parse the file, and managing access and rotation would remain largely a manual or custom-developed process.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Storing the credential file on an encrypted EBS volume still involves managing a file on the EC2 instance. This does not centralize credential management, nor does it offer any mechanism for automatic rotation. It does little to reduce the operational overhead associated with the credential lifecycle (e.g., changing passwords regularly) and still leaves credentials vulnerable if the instance itself is compromised.

  <summary>Question 12</summary>
    
A global company hosts its web application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The web application has static data and dynamic data. The company stores its static data in an Amazon S3 bucket. The company wants to improve performance and reduce latency for the static data and dynamic data. The company is using its own domain name registered with Amazon Route 53.

What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the S3 bucket and the ALB as origins. Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution.
- [ ] B. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the ALB as an origin. Create an AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerator that has the S3 bucket as an endpoint Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution.
- [ ] C. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the S3 bucket as an origin. Create an AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerator that has the ALB and the CloudFront distribution as endpoints. Create a custom domain name that points to the accelerator DNS name. Use the custom domain name as an endpoint for the web application.
- [ ] D. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the ALB as an origin. Create an AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerator that has the S3 bucket as an endpoint. Create two domain names. Point one domain name to the CloudFront DNS name for dynamic content. Point the other domain name to the accelerator DNS name for static content. Use the domain names as endpoints for the web application.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] A. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the S3 bucket and the ALB as origins. Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Comprehensive Content Delivery with CloudFront: Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that can significantly improve performance and reduce latency for both static and dynamic content.
- [ ] Static Content: CloudFront can cache static data from the Amazon S3 bucket at edge locations around the world, closer to the users. This drastically reduces latency for accessing these files.
- [ ] Dynamic Content: CloudFront can also serve dynamic content from the Application Load Balancer (ALB). Requests for dynamic content are routed through CloudFront's optimized network to the ALB, benefiting from features like persistent connections and SSL/TLS termination at the edge.
- [ ] Multiple Origins and Behaviors: A single CloudFront distribution can be configured with multiple origins (the S3 bucket for static content and the ALB for dynamic content). Cache behaviors can then be defined to route specific URL path patterns to the appropriate origin (e.g., /images/* to S3, /api/* to ALB).
- [ ] Simplified DNS: By configuring Amazon Route 53 to point the company's domain name to the CloudFront distribution, all user traffic is directed through CloudFront, ensuring that both static and dynamic content delivery is accelerated. This provides a unified and efficient solution.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option B is wrong because: While AWS Global Accelerator improves performance for applications by routing traffic over the AWS global network to optimal endpoints, CloudFront is generally the more suitable and cost-effective solution for caching and delivering static web content from S3. This option proposes using CloudFront only for the ALB (dynamic content) and Global Accelerator for the S3 bucket (static content). A single CloudFront distribution can handle both more effectively.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: This solution is overly complex. It suggests using CloudFront for static S3 content and then placing an AWS Global Accelerator in front of both the ALB and this CloudFront distribution. CloudFront itself is designed to be the primary edge delivery service for web applications, capable of handling both static and dynamic content by routing to different origins. Adding Global Accelerator on top of CloudFront for static content adds an unnecessary layer.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: This option introduces complexity by suggesting separate delivery mechanisms (CloudFront for dynamic, Global Accelerator for static) and potentially requiring two different domain names or complex application logic to route requests. A single CloudFront distribution with multiple origins and behaviors is a more streamlined and standard approach for handling both types of content under one domain. CloudFront's caching capabilities are more beneficial for static S3 content than using Global Accelerator alone for it.

A company performs monthly maintenance on its AWS infrastructure. During these maintenance activities, the company needs to rotate the credentials for its Amazon RDS for MySQL databases across multiple AWS Regions.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- [ ] A. Store the credentials as secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. Use multi-Region secret replication for the required Regions. Configure Secrets Manager to rotate the secrets on a schedule.
- [ ] B. Store the credentials as secrets in AWS Systems Manager by creating a secure string parameter. Use multi-Region secret replication for the required Regions. Configure Systems Manager to rotate the secrets on a schedule.
- [ ] C. Store the credentials in an Amazon S3 bucket that has server-side encryption (SSE) enabled. Use Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) to invoke an AWS Lambda function to rotate the credentials.
- [ ] D. Encrypt the credentials as secrets by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) multi-Region customer managed keys. Store the secrets in an Amazon DynamoDB global table. Use an AWS Lambda function to retrieve the secrets from DynamoDB. Use the RDS API to rotate the secrets.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] A. Store the credentials as secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. Use multi-Region secret replication for the required Regions. Configure Secrets Manager to rotate the secrets on a schedule.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] AWS Secrets Manager for RDS: AWS Secrets Manager is specifically designed for managing secrets, including database credentials. It has built-in integration for automatically rotating credentials for Amazon RDS databases (including MySQL) on a defined schedule (e.g., monthly).    
- [ ] Multi-Region Secret Replication: Secrets Manager supports multi-Region replication.  This means you can create a primary secret in one region and replicate it to other specified AWS Regions. When the primary secret is rotated, the new version is automatically replicated. This ensures that applications or services in different regions can access the up-to-date credentials for the RDS databases.   
- [ ] Least Operational Overhead: This solution leverages managed AWS services for storing, rotating, and replicating secrets. Configuring automatic rotation and replication in Secrets Manager is straightforward and requires minimal ongoing operational effort compared to building custom solutions.    

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option B is wrong because: While AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store can store secrets (as SecureStrings) and also supports multi-Region parameters, its native automatic rotation capabilities for database credentials like RDS are not as direct or as feature-rich as AWS Secrets Manager. Achieving scheduled rotation for RDS often requires more custom setup (e.g., with Lambda functions) if using Parameter Store, thus increasing operational overhead compared to Secrets Manager's built-in RDS rotation.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Storing credentials in an Amazon S3 bucket, even with server-side encryption, is not a recommended practice for active database credentials.  This approach would require building a custom solution using Amazon EventBridge and AWS Lambda to handle the rotation logic and distribution of credentials, which would involve significant development and ongoing operational overhead.    
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: This describes a highly custom and complex solution. It involves using AWS KMS for encryption, Amazon DynamoDB global tables for storing the secrets, and an AWS Lambda function for the retrieval and rotation logic.  Building and maintaining such a system would entail substantial operational overhead compared to using the purpose-built functionalities of AWS Secrets Manager.

  <summary>Question 14</summary>
   
A company runs an ecommerce application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The instances run in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. The Auto Scaling group scales based on CPU utilization metrics. The ecommerce application stores the transaction data in a MySQL 8.0 database that is hosted on a large EC2 instance.

The database's performance degrades quickly as application load increases. The application handles more read requests than write transactions. The company wants a solution that will automatically scale the database to meet the demand of unpredictable read workloads while maintaining high availability.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Use Amazon Redshift with a single node for leader and compute functionality.
- [ ] B. Use Amazon RDS with a Single-AZ deployment Configure Amazon RDS to add reader instances in a different Availability Zone.
- [ ] C. Use Amazon Aurora with a Multi-AZ deployment. Configure Aurora Auto Scaling with Aurora Replicas.
- [ ] D. Use Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached with EC2 Spot Instances.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] C. Use Amazon Aurora with a Multi-AZ deployment. Configure Aurora Auto Scaling with Aurora Replicas.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Amazon Aurora for High Availability and Read Scalability: Amazon Aurora is a MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database service. An Aurora Multi-AZ deployment ensures high availability by replicating data across multiple Availability Zones.
- [ ] Aurora Auto Scaling with Aurora Replicas: Aurora specifically addresses the need for read scalability with Aurora Replicas. You can configure Aurora Auto Scaling to automatically add or remove Aurora Replicas based on metrics like CPU utilization or number of connections. This is ideal for handling "unpredictable read workloads" and applications that are "more read requests than write transactions," as stated in the question. This allows the read capacity to scale dynamically without manual intervention.
- [ ] MySQL Compatibility: Since the existing database is MySQL 8.0, migrating to Amazon Aurora (MySQL compatible edition) would be a relatively straightforward path.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Amazon Redshift is a data warehousing service designed for online analytical processing (OLAP) and business intelligence, not for transactional workloads (OLTP) typical of an ecommerce application's primary database. A single-node Redshift cluster also does not offer high availability.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: An Amazon RDS "Single-AZ deployment" for the primary database instance is not highly available. If the single Availability Zone experiences an issue, the database will become unavailable. The requirement is to maintain high availability. While RDS allows for read replicas, Aurora's Auto Scaling for replicas is generally more dynamic and integrated for handling unpredictable read scaling.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached is an in-memory caching service. While it can significantly improve read performance by caching frequently accessed data and reducing load on the database, it is not a persistent database itself. It complements a database but doesn't replace it or solve its underlying scaling and availability needs for persistent storage. Furthermore, using EC2 Spot Instances for a critical component like a cache (especially if data loss on interruption is an issue) or for a database itself is not recommended for production ecommerce applications requiring high availability.

  <summary>Question 15</summary>
  
A company recently migrated to AWS and wants to implement a solution to protect the traffic that flows in and out of the production VPC. The company had an inspection server in its on-premises data center. The inspection server performed specific operations such as traffic flow inspection and traffic filtering. The company wants to have the same functionalities in the AWS Cloud.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

- [ ]  A. Use Amazon GuardDuty for traffic inspection and traffic filtering in the production VPC.
- [ ]  B. Use Traffic Mirroring to mirror traffic from the production VPC for traffic inspection and filtering.
- [ ]  C. Use AWS Network Firewall to create the required rules for traffic inspection and traffic filtering for the production VPC.
- [ ]  D. Use AWS Firewall Manager to create the required rules for traffic inspection and traffic filtering for the production VPC.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ]  C. Use AWS Network Firewall to create the required rules for traffic inspection and traffic filtering for the production VPC.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ]  AWS Network Firewall is a managed, stateful firewall service that provides network protections for your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). It allows you to define granular firewall rules for traffic inspection (e.g., deep packet inspection) and filtering for both ingress and egress traffic for your VPC.
- [ ]  This service directly provides the "traffic flow inspection and traffic filtering" capabilities that replicate the functionality of an on-premises inspection server.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ]  Option A is wrong because: Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service. It continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior by analyzing AWS CloudTrail logs, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs. While GuardDuty inspects traffic patterns to identify threats, it is primarily a detection and alerting service. It does not perform active traffic filtering (blocking or allowing traffic based on rules) in the way a firewall does.
- [ ]  Option B is wrong because: Traffic Mirroring allows you to copy network traffic from an EC2 instance's elastic network interface and send it to out-of-band security and monitoring appliances. While this enables "traffic inspection" by those appliances, Traffic Mirroring itself doesn't perform filtering. You would still need a separate tool or system to analyze the mirrored traffic and then another mechanism to enforce filtering rules. AWS Network Firewall offers inline inspection and filtering.
- [ ]  Option D is wrong because: AWS Firewall Manager is a security management service that helps you centrally configure and manage firewall rules across your accounts and applications. You can use it to manage AWS WAF rules, AWS Shield Advanced protections, VPC security groups, AWS Network Firewall policies, and Amazon Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall rules. While Firewall Manager would be used to deploy and manage AWS Network Firewall rules at scale, the service that actually provides the inspection and filtering functionality within the VPC is AWS Network Firewall itself. The question asks for the solution that performs the functionalities.

A company hosts a data lake on AWS. The data lake consists of data in Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. The company needs a reporting solution that provides data visualization and includes all the data sources within the data lake. Only the company's management team should have full access to all the visualizations. The rest of the company should have only limited access.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

- [ ]  A. Create an analysis in Amazon QuickSight. Connect all the data sources and create new datasets. Publish dashboards to visualize the data. Share the dashboards with the appropriate IAM roles. 
- [ ]  B. Create an analysis in Amazon QuickSight. Connect all the data sources and create new datasets. Publish dashboards to visualize the data. Share the dashboards with the appropriate users and groups. 
- [ ]  C. Create an AWS Glue table and crawler for the data in Amazon S3. Create an AWS Glue extract, transform, and load (ETL) job to produce reports. Publish the reports to Amazon S3. Use S3 bucket policies to limit access to the reports. 
- [ ]  D. Create an AWS Glue table and crawler for the data in Amazon S3. Use Amazon Athena Federated Query to access data within Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. Generate reports by using Amazon Athena. Publish the reports to Amazon S3. Use S3 bucket policies to limit access to the reports. 

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ]  B. Create an analysis in Amazon QuickSight. Connect all the data sources and create new datasets. Publish dashboards to visualize the data. Share the dashboards with the appropriate users and groups. 

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Amazon QuickSight for Data Visualization: Amazon QuickSight is a business intelligence (BI) service that enables users to create interactive dashboards and visualizations. It can connect to a wide variety of data sources, including Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS (which includes PostgreSQL).  This directly meets the requirement for a "reporting solution that provides data visualization and includes all the data sources."    
- [ ] Connecting Data Sources: QuickSight allows you to connect to both S3 and RDS for PostgreSQL, create datasets from this data, and then build analyses and dashboards.    
- [ ] Granular Sharing and Permissions: QuickSight has its own user and group management system (which can be integrated with IAM Identity Center or be based on email invitations). Dashboards published in QuickSight can be shared with specific QuickSight users or groups, and you can define their access levels (e.g., viewer or co-owner). This allows the company to give the management team full access while providing limited access to the rest of the company, as required.    

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: While QuickSight is the correct tool, sharing of QuickSight dashboards and analyses is primarily managed through QuickSight's own user and group system, not directly by assigning IAM roles to dashboards for access control in the way IAM roles control access to AWS resources like S3 buckets or EC2 instances. Option B more accurately describes how QuickSight sharing works.    
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: This solution focuses on generating static reports using AWS Glue ETL jobs and storing them in Amazon S3.  While this can fulfill some reporting needs, it does not provide the interactive "data visualization" capabilities that are typically expected from a modern BI solution and are a key feature of QuickSight.  Managing fine-grained access to different visualizations for various user groups through S3 bucket policies can also be more cumbersome than QuickSight's built-in sharing model.   
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Similar to option C, this approach relies on generating reports (using Amazon Athena with Federated Query for RDS data) and storing them in S3.  While Athena is excellent for querying data in S3 and federated sources, this solution still primarily delivers reports rather than the interactive "data visualization" dashboards that QuickSight provides.

A company is implementing a new business application. The application runs on two Amazon EC2 instances and uses an Amazon S3 bucket for document storage. A solutions architect needs to ensure that the EC2 instances can access the S3 bucket.

What should the solutions architect do to meet this requirement?

- [ ] A. Create an IAM role that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the role to the EC2 instances.
- [ ] B. Create an IAM policy that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the policy to the EC2 instances.
- [ ] C. Create an IAM group that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the group to the EC2 instances.
- [ ] D. Create an IAM user that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the user account to the EC2 instances.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] A. Create an IAM role that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the role to the EC2 instances.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] IAM Roles for EC2 Instances: The most secure and recommended way for an Amazon EC2 instance to access other AWS services (like Amazon S3) is by using an IAM role.
- [ ] How it Works: You create an IAM role and attach an IAM policy to it that grants the necessary permissions to access the S3 bucket (e.g., s3:GetObject, s3:PutObject).
- [ ] Then, you associate this IAM role with your EC2 instances via an instance profile. The EC2 instances automatically receive temporary security credentials from the role, which the application can use to make requests to S3. This method avoids storing long-term AWS credentials (like access keys) directly on the EC2 instances.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option B is wrong because: While an IAM policy defines the permissions, you cannot directly attach an IAM policy to an EC2 instance. IAM policies are attached to IAM identities such as users, groups, or roles. The role is then attached to the EC2 instance.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: IAM groups are collections of IAM users and are used to manage permissions for multiple users. You cannot attach an IAM group to an EC2 instance to grant it permissions. EC2 instances leverage IAM roles for permissions.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Creating an IAM user and embedding its long-term access keys (access key ID and secret access key) on the EC2 instances is not a security best practice. These credentials could be exposed if the instance is compromised. IAM roles provide a more secure mechanism by using temporary credentials that are automatically rotated.

An application development team is designing a microservice that will convert large images to smaller, compressed images. When a user uploads an image through the web interface, the microservice should store the image in an Amazon S3 bucket, process and compress the image with an AWS Lambda function, and store the image in its compressed form in a different S3 bucket.

A solutions architect needs to design a solution that uses durable, stateless components to process the images automatically.

Which combination of actions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

- [ ]  A. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the S3 bucket to send a notification to the SQS queue when an image is uploaded to the S3 bucket.
- [ ]  B. Configure the Lambda function to use the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the invocation source. When the SQS message is successfully processed, delete the message in the queue.
- [ ]  C. Configure the Lambda function to monitor the S3 bucket for new uploads. When an uploaded image is detected, write the file name to a text file in memory and use the text file to keep track of the images that were processed.
- [ ]  D. Launch an Amazon EC2 instance to monitor an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. When items are added to the queue, log the file name in a text file on the EC2 instance and invoke the Lambda function.
- [ ]  E. Configure an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) event to monitor the S3 bucket. When an image is uploaded, send an alert to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with the application owner's email address for further processing.

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ]  A. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the S3 bucket to send a notification to the SQS queue when an image is uploaded to the S3 bucket.
- [ ]  B. Configure the Lambda function to use the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the invocation source. When the SQS message is successfully processed, delete the message in the queue.

Why these are the correct answers:

This solution creates a robust, decoupled, and scalable image processing pipeline using durable and stateless components:

A. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the S3 bucket to send a notification to the SQS queue when an image is uploaded to the S3 bucket.

- [ ]  Durability and Decoupling: When an image is uploaded to the source S3 bucket, an S3 event notification sends a message (containing details like the bucket name and object key) to an SQS queue. SQS is a highly available and durable message queuing service.
- [ ]  This decouples the image upload event from the processing logic. If the processing function (Lambda) is temporarily unavailable or fails, the message remains in the SQS queue and can be processed later, preventing data loss. SQS acts as a durable buffer.

B. Configure the Lambda function to use the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the invocation source. When the SQS message is successfully processed, delete the message in the queue.

- [ ]  Stateless Processing: AWS Lambda functions are inherently stateless compute services. Lambda can be configured to automatically poll the SQS queue for new messages.
- [ ]  When a message is received, the Lambda function is invoked to process the image (retrieve from S3, compress, and store in the destination S3 bucket).
- [ ]  Reliable Processing: After the Lambda function successfully processes the image and the associated SQS message, it should delete the message from the queue.
- [ ]  This ensures that the image is processed (at least once, and with idempotent design, effectively once) and prevents reprocessing of the same message.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

Option C is wrong because: While Lambda can be triggered directly by S3 events, the part about "write the file name to a text file in memory and use the text file to keep track of the images that were processed" introduces statefulness within the Lambda function's memory. This is not durable; if the Lambda invocation fails before completion or if multiple concurrent invocations occur, this in-memory tracking can be lost or become inconsistent. The requirement is for "durable, stateless components." SQS provides better durability for the event notification.

Option D is wrong because: Using an Amazon EC2 instance to monitor an SQS queue and then invoke a Lambda function adds unnecessary complexity and operational overhead. Lambda can be directly integrated with SQS as an event source, where Lambda polls the queue automatically. Managing an EC2 instance for this task goes against the serverless approach of using Lambda and also introduces a stateful component (the EC2 instance and its local text file) where it's not needed.

Option E is wrong because: While Amazon EventBridge can detect S3 events and Amazon SNS can send notifications, sending an alert to an "application owner's email address for further processing" does not automate the image processing workflow as required. The problem states the Lambda function should process and compress the image. This option describes a manual intervention step, not an automated processing solution.

A company has a three-tier web application that is deployed on AWS. The web servers are deployed in a public subnet in a VPC. The application servers and database servers are deployed in private subnets in the same VPC. The company has deployed a third-party virtual firewall appliance from AWS Marketplace in an inspection VPC. The appliance is configured with an IP interface that can accept IP packets.

A solutions architect needs to integrate the web application with the appliance to inspect all traffic to the application before the traffic reaches the web server.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- [ ]  A. Create a Network Load Balancer in the public subnet of the application's VPC to route the traffic to the appliance for packet inspection.
- [ ]  B. Create an Application Load Balancer in the public subnet of the application's VPC to route the traffic to the appliance for packet inspection.
- [ ]  C. Deploy a transit gateway in the inspection VPC. Configure route tables to route the incoming packets through the transit gateway.
- [ ]  D. Deploy a Gateway Load Balancer in the inspection VPC. Create a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint to receive the incoming packets and forward the packets to the appliance.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ]  D. Deploy a Gateway Load Balancer in the inspection VPC. Create a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint to receive the incoming packets and forward the packets to the appliance.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ]  Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB): AWS Gateway Load Balancer is specifically designed to make it easy to deploy, scale, and manage third-party virtual network appliances, such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and deep packet inspection systems. It operates at Layer 3 (network layer) and is transparent to the traffic flow.   
- [ ]  Gateway Load Balancer Endpoint (GWLBE): You deploy GWLB in the inspection VPC where your virtual firewall appliances are located. Then, you create Gateway Load Balancer Endpoints (GWLBEs) in your application VPC (in this case, in the public subnet or in a subnet that processes traffic before it reaches the web servers).
- [ ]  Route tables in the application VPC are then configured to send traffic destined for the web servers through the GWLBE.
- [ ]  The GWLBE forwards the traffic to the GWLB, which distributes it to the firewall appliances for inspection. After inspection, the traffic is routed back through the GWLBE to its original destination (the web servers).
- [ ]  Least Operational Overhead: This solution simplifies the integration of third-party appliances, providing high availability and scalability for the appliance fleet with less complex routing and configuration compared to other methods. It handles challenges like maintaining flow symmetry.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ]  Option A is wrong because: While a Network Load Balancer (NLB) operates at Layer 4 and could distribute traffic to appliances, it's not specifically designed for transparently inserting a fleet of inspection appliances into the traffic path as effectively as GWLB. GWLB provides features tailored for this use case, like flow stickiness to a specific appliance instance and simpler integration via GWLBEs for inline inspection.
- [ ]  Option B is wrong because: An Application Load Balancer (ALB) operates at Layer 7 (application layer, primarily for HTTP/HTTPS). Virtual firewall appliances typically need to inspect raw IP packets at lower network layers (Layer 3 or 4). An ALB terminates HTTP/HTTPS connections and would not be suitable for forwarding raw IP packets to such an appliance for general inspection.
- [ ]  Option C is wrong because: While a Transit Gateway is used for interconnecting VPCs and on-premises networks and would likely be part of the overall architecture to route traffic between the application VPC and the inspection VPC, it does not itself provide the load balancing and transparent integration capabilities for a fleet of virtual appliances that GWLB offers. You might use Transit Gateway to route traffic to the GWLB, but GWLB is the key component for integrating the appliances themselves.

  <summary>Question 20</summary>

A company wants to improve its ability to clone large amounts of production data into a test environment in the same AWS Region. The data is stored in Amazon EC2 instances on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. Modifications to the cloned data must not affect the production environment. The software that accesses this data requires consistently high I/O performance.

A solutions architect needs to minimize the time that is required to clone the production data into the test environment.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Restore the snapshots onto EC2 instance store volumes in the test environment.
- [ ] B. Configure the production EBS volumes to use the EBS Multi-Attach feature. Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Attach the production EBS volumes to the EC2 instances in the test environment.
- [ ] C. Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Create and initialize new EBS volumes. Attach the new EBS volumes to EC2 instances in the test environment before restoring the volumes from the production EBS snapshots.
- [ ] D. Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Turn on the EBS fast snapshot restore feature on the EBS snapshots. Restore the snapshots into new EBS volumes. Attach the new EBS volumes to EC2 instances in the test environment.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] D. Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Turn on the EBS fast snapshot restore feature on the EBS snapshots. Restore the snapshots into new EBS volumes. Attach the new EBS volumes to EC2 instances in the test environment.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] EBS Snapshots for Independent Clones: Taking EBS snapshots of the production volumes and then restoring these snapshots to new EBS volumes is the standard method for creating independent clones. This ensures that "Modifications to the cloned data must not affect the production environment."
- [ ] EBS Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR): Normally, when an EBS volume is created from a snapshot, data is loaded lazily from S3 (where snapshots are stored) to the EBS volume.
- [ ] This can result in higher latency for initial I/O operations until the volume is fully hydrated.
- [ ] EBS Fast Snapshot Restore allows you to enable faster restores of EBS snapshots by fully pre-warming the snapshot data. When you create a volume from an FSR-enabled snapshot, it receives its full I/O performance immediately.
- [ ] This addresses the requirements for "consistently high I/O performance" from the outset and helps to "minimize the time that is required to clone the production data" by making the cloned volumes performant right away.
- [ ] New EBS Volumes for Test: Restoring snapshots into new EBS volumes for the test environment ensures data isolation.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: EC2 instance store volumes are ephemeral storage, meaning data is lost if the instance is stopped, hibernated, or terminated. While they offer very high I/O performance, they are not suitable for storing cloned production data that needs to persist for a test environment. Restoring an EBS snapshot to an instance store is generally not a recommended or durable approach for this use case.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: EBS Multi-Attach allows a single Provisioned IOPS SSD EBS volume to be attached to multiple EC2 instances within the same Availability Zone. However, attaching the production EBS volumes directly to test environment EC2 instances, even after taking snapshots, is highly risky and directly contradicts the requirement that modifications to test data must not affect production. This would lead to data corruption in the production environment if the test instances write to the shared production volumes.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: The wording "Create and initialize new EBS volumes... Attach the new EBS volumes... before restoring the volumes from the production EBS snapshots" is illogical. You typically create a new volume from a snapshot, or restore a snapshot to a new volume. More importantly, if you just create a volume from a regular snapshot (without FSR), it will still undergo the lazy loading process, which can impact initial I/O performance. This option does not guarantee consistently high I/O performance from the moment of creation, nor does it minimize the time to achieve full performance as effectively as FSR.

  <summary>Question 21</summary>

An ecommerce company wants to launch a one-deal-a-day website on AWS. Each day will feature exactly one product on sale for a period of 24 hours. The company wants to be able to handle millions of requests each hour with millisecond latency during peak hours.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- [ ]  A. Use Amazon S3 to host the full website in different S3 buckets. Add Amazon CloudFront distributions. Set the S3 buckets as origins for the distributions. Store the order data in Amazon S3.
- [ ]  B. Deploy the full website on Amazon EC2 instances that run in Auto Scaling groups across multiple Availability Zones. Add an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute the website traffic. Add another ALB for the backend APIs. Store the data in Amazon RDS for MySQL.
- [ ]  C. Migrate the full application to run in containers. Host the containers on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). Use the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler to increase and decrease the number of pods to process bursts in traffic. Store the data in Amazon RDS for MySQL.
- [ ]  D. Use an Amazon S3 bucket to host the website's static content. Deploy an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Set the S3 bucket as the origin. Use Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda functions for the backend APIs. Store the data in Amazon DynamoDB.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ]  D. Use an Amazon S3 bucket to host the website's static content. Deploy an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Set the S3 bucket as the origin. Use Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda functions for the backend APIs. Store the data in Amazon DynamoDB.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Static Content Hosting (S3 and CloudFront): For a "one-deal-a-day" website, much of the content (product description, images, pricing for that day) is static.
- [ ] Hosting this static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) in an Amazon S3 bucket and distributing it via Amazon CloudFront provides high scalability ("millions of requests each hour") and low latency ("millisecond latency") due to CloudFront's global network of edge locations. This setup has very low operational overhead.
- [ ] Serverless Backend (API Gateway and Lambda): For dynamic functionalities like processing orders, handling user interactions, or inventory checks, using Amazon API Gateway to create RESTful APIs that trigger AWS Lambda functions is a highly scalable, pay-per-use, and low operational overhead approach. Lambda functions can execute code in response to API calls without needing to manage servers.
- [ ] Scalable Database (DynamoDB): Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.
- [ ] It is well-suited for ecommerce applications that require low-latency data access and can handle high request volumes, such as storing order information or user session data. Its serverless nature means no servers to manage.   
- [ ] Least Operational Overhead: This combination of serverless and managed services (S3, CloudFront, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB) minimizes infrastructure management, patching, and manual scaling efforts, directly meeting the requirement for the "LEAST operational overhead."

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: While using S3 and CloudFront for hosting is good, storing "order data in Amazon S3" is not appropriate for a transactional system. S3 is an object store, not a database designed for frequent, low-latency transactional reads and writes with querying capabilities needed for order management.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: Deploying the application on Amazon EC2 instances, even with Auto Scaling and Application Load Balancers, involves significantly more operational overhead (managing instances, operating systems, scaling policies, patching) compared to a serverless architecture like the one described in option D.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Migrating to containers on Amazon EKS introduces considerable operational complexity. Managing a Kubernetes cluster, even with EKS, requires expertise and effort for cluster operations, node management, and container orchestration. This is generally more operationally intensive than a serverless approach, especially when "LEAST operational overhead" is a primary goal.

  <summary>Question 22</summary>
  
A solutions architect is using Amazon S3 to design the storage architecture of a new digital media application. The media files must be resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone. Some files are accessed frequently while other files are rarely accessed in an unpredictable pattern. The solutions architect must minimize the costs of storing and retrieving the media files.

Which storage option meets these requirements?

- [ ]  A. S3 Standard
- [ ]  B. S3 Intelligent-Tiering
- [ ]  C. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
- [ ]  D. S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ]  B. S3 Intelligent-Tiering

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Resilience to Availability Zone Loss: S3 Intelligent-Tiering stores data across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) by default, just like S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA. This means it is resilient to the loss of a single AZ.    
- [ ] Handles Unpredictable Access Patterns: The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is specifically designed for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns.
- [ ] It automatically monitors access patterns and moves objects that have not been accessed for a certain period to a lower-cost infrequent access tier.
- [ ] If an object in the infrequent access tier is accessed, it is automatically moved back to the frequent access tier. This is done without performance impact or retrieval fees between these two tiers.
- [ ] This perfectly matches the requirement for files accessed "frequently while other files are rarely accessed in an unpredictable pattern."    
- [ ] Cost Minimization: By automatically tiering data based on access, S3 Intelligent-Tiering helps to minimize storage costs without the operational overhead of creating and managing S3 Lifecycle policies for data with unpredictable access.
- [ ] It provides the performance of S3 Standard for frequently accessed objects and the cost savings of an infrequent access tier for objects that become cold.
- [ ] There are no retrieval fees when data is moved between the frequent and infrequent access tiers within S3 Intelligent-Tiering.    

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: S3 Standard is designed for frequently accessed data and provides high durability and availability across multiple AZs.  However, it is not the most cost-effective option if a significant portion of the media files are rarely accessed, as it has a higher storage cost compared to infrequent access tiers.  It doesn't automatically optimize costs for unpredictable access patterns.    
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) is designed for data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed and is resilient to AZ loss. While it offers lower storage costs than S3 Standard, it has data retrieval fees. For "unpredictable access patterns," if data thought to be infrequent is suddenly accessed frequently, these retrieval fees could add up and might negate the storage cost savings. S3 Intelligent-Tiering avoids this retrieval fee concern between its main tiers.    
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) stores data in a single Availability Zone. This means it is not resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone, which is a specific requirement ("media files must be resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone").  While it is a lower-cost option, it doesn't meet the resiliency criteria.

  <summary>Question 23</summary>

A company is storing backup files by using Amazon S3 Standard storage. The files are accessed frequently for 1 month. However, the files are not accessed after 1 month. The company must keep the files indefinitely.

Which storage solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

- [ ]  A. Configure S3 Intelligent-Tiering to automatically migrate objects.
- [ ]  B. Create an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 month.
- [ ]  C. Create an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 1 month.
- [ ]  D. Create an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 1 month.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ]  B. Create an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 month.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Predictable Access Pattern: The problem states a clear and predictable access pattern: files are accessed frequently for the first month and then not accessed thereafter, but must be kept indefinitely.
- [ ] S3 Glacier Deep Archive for Long-Term, Cold Storage: Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive is the lowest-cost storage class in Amazon S3 and is designed for long-term data archiving where data is rarely accessed (e.g., once or twice a year) and retrieval times of several hours are acceptable.
- [ ] Since the backup files are not accessed after 1 month and must be kept indefinitely, transitioning them to S3 Glacier Deep Archive is the MOST cost-effective solution for long-term storage.
- [ ] S3 Lifecycle Configuration: An S3 Lifecycle configuration can be easily set up to automatically transition objects from S3 Standard (where they reside for the first month of frequent access) directly to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 30 days (or 1 month).

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: S3 Intelligent-Tiering is optimized for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns. In this scenario, the access pattern is known and predictable. While S3 Intelligent-Tiering can eventually move data to archive access tiers, for data that is definitively cold and will not be accessed after a specific period, a direct lifecycle transition to S3 Glacier Deep Archive is generally more cost-effective and straightforward. S3 Intelligent-Tiering also incurs a small per-object monitoring and automation fee.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) is designed for data that is accessed less frequently but still requires rapid access when needed. While it has lower storage costs than S3 Standard, its storage costs are significantly higher than S3 Glacier Deep Archive. Given that the files are not accessed at all after one month and must be kept indefinitely, S3 Standard-IA is not the most cost-effective long-term archival solution.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) stores data in a single Availability Zone. This means it is not resilient to the physical loss of that Availability Zone. For backup files that must be kept "indefinitely," relying on a storage class with lower durability (due to being single-AZ) is generally not advisable, especially when multi-AZ archival options like S3 Glacier Deep Archive offer very low costs with higher durability. The priority for indefinite backups should include durability.

  <summary>Question 24</summary>
   
A company observes an increase in Amazon EC2 costs in its most recent bill. The billing team notices unwanted vertical scaling of instance types for a couple of EC2 instances. A solutions architect needs to create a graph comparing the last 2 months of EC2 costs and perform an in-depth analysis to identify the root cause of the vertical scaling.

How should the solutions architect generate the information with the LEAST operational overhead?

- [ ] A. Use AWS Budgets to create a budget report and compare EC2 costs based on instance types.
- [ ] B. Use Cost Explorer's granular filtering feature to perform an in-depth analysis of EC2 costs based on instance types.
- [ ] C. Use graphs from the AWS Billing and Cost Management dashboard to compare EC2 costs based on instance types for the last 2 months.
- [ ] D. Use AWS Cost and Usage Reports to create a report and send it to an Amazon S3 bucket. Use Amazon QuickSight with Amazon S3 as a source to generate an interactive graph based on instance types.



</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ]   B. Use Cost Explorer's granular filtering feature to perform an in-depth analysis of EC2 costs based on instance types.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] AWS Cost Explorer for Analysis: AWS Cost Explorer is an interactive tool that allows you to visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time.
- [ ] It is specifically designed for ad-hoc analysis and exploration of cost data.
- [ ] Graphing and Comparison: Cost Explorer can easily generate graphs comparing costs over specified periods, such as the last 2 months.
- [ ] Granular Filtering by Instance Type: A key feature of Cost Explorer is its ability to filter and group cost and usage data by various dimensions, including service (EC2), region, usage type, and critically for this scenario, instance type. This allows the solutions architect to drill down into EC2 costs, identify trends related to specific instance types, and investigate the "unwanted vertical scaling."
- [ ] Least Operational Overhead: Using Cost Explorer's built-in interface and features for this type of analysis requires minimal setup. The data is readily available, and the tool provides the necessary graphing and filtering capabilities out-of-the-box. This aligns with the requirement for the "LEAST operational overhead."

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: AWS Budgets is primarily used for setting spending limits and receiving alerts when costs or usage exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) those limits. While budget reports can provide some insights, Cost Explorer is the more appropriate tool for detailed, ad-hoc investigation and root cause analysis of cost spikes or specific usage patterns like changes in instance types.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: The AWS Billing and Cost Management dashboard provides a high-level overview of your AWS spending (e.g., month-to-date spend by service, cost trends). While it offers some basic graphs, it generally lacks the deep, granular filtering and analytical capabilities of Cost Explorer needed to perform an "in-depth analysis" to identify the root cause of vertical scaling by instance type over a 2-month period.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) provide the most detailed cost and usage data, but analyzing this data typically requires additional tools. Setting up CUR, configuring delivery to an S3 bucket, and then using Amazon QuickSight (or another BI tool) to ingest, prepare, and visualize this data involves significantly more setup, configuration, and operational overhead compared to using Cost Explorer directly for this specific task. While powerful for complex reporting, it's not the solution with the "LEAST operational overhead" for this scenario.

  <summary>Question 25</summary>

A company is designing an application. The application uses an AWS Lambda function to receive information through Amazon API Gateway and to store the information in an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database. During the proof-of-concept stage, the company has to increase the Lambda quotas significantly to handle the high volumes of data that the company needs to load into the database.

A solutions architect must recommend a new design to improve scalability and minimize the configuration effort.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Refactor the Lambda function code to Apache Tomcat code that runs on Amazon EC2 instances. Connect the database by using native Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) drivers.
- [ ] B. Change the platform from Aurora to Amazon DynamoDB. Provision a DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster. Use the DAX client SDK to point the existing DynamoDB API calls at the DAX cluster.
- [ ] C. Set up two Lambda functions. Configure one function to receive the information. Configure the other function to load the information into the database. Integrate the Lambda functions by using Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).
- [ ] D. Set up two Lambda functions. Configure one function to receive the information. Configure the other function to load the information into the database. Integrate the Lambda functions by using an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] D. Set up two Lambda functions. Configure one function to receive the information. Configure the other function to load the information into the database. Integrate the Lambda functions by using an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Decoupling with SQS for Scalability and Resilience: The core issue is handling "high volumes of data" that stressed the original Lambda function, requiring quota increases. By introducing an Amazon SQS queue, you decouple the data ingestion (from API Gateway) from the database writing process.
- [ ] The first Lambda function (or API Gateway directly) receives the information and quickly places it as a message onto an SQS queue. This is a fast operation.
- [ ] The SQS queue acts as a durable buffer, holding these messages.
- [ ] The second Lambda function is configured to process messages from the SQS queue and write them to the Aurora PostgreSQL database. This function can process messages at a rate that the database can comfortably handle, preventing it from being overwhelmed.
- [ ] Improved Scalability: SQS can handle massive throughput of messages. The Lambda functions can scale independently. The receiving Lambda can scale to handle bursts from API Gateway, and the database-writing Lambda can scale based on the queue depth, with its concurrency potentially limited to avoid overloading the database. This effectively manages the "high volumes of data."
- [ ] Minimized Configuration Effort (for the new design): This serverless pattern (API Gateway -> SQS -> Lambda -> Database) is a common and well-supported architecture. While it adds an SQS queue and potentially a second Lambda, it leverages managed services and generally involves less ongoing configuration and operational overhead for scaling and maintenance compared to moving to EC2 instances (Option A). It addresses the Lambda scaling issue without a complete platform overhaul (Option B).
- [ ] Resilience: If the database-writing Lambda fails or is temporarily throttled, messages remain in the SQS queue for later processing (potentially with a Dead-Letter Queue for error handling), improving the overall resilience of the data loading process.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Refactoring to an Apache Tomcat application running on Amazon EC2 instances introduces significant operational overhead (managing servers, patching, scaling EC2 infrastructure) compared to the serverless Lambda approach. This contradicts the goal of minimizing configuration effort, especially for scaling and maintenance.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: Changing the database platform from Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL (a relational database) to Amazon DynamoDB (a NoSQL database) is a major architectural shift. This would likely require substantial changes to the application's data model, query patterns, and overall code, which is far from "minimizing configuration effort" in the context of solving a Lambda scaling problem. While DynamoDB with DAX is highly scalable, this solution doesn't directly address the Lambda processing bottleneck without extensive rework.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: While Amazon SNS can be used to trigger a Lambda function, SQS is generally a better choice for buffering and decoupling when there's a work queue involved, especially for tasks like writing to a database that might have rate limitations. SQS provides features like message visibility timeouts, retry mechanisms, and dead-letter queues (DLQs) that are very useful for managing asynchronous task processing. SNS is more suited for fan-out notification patterns to multiple, independent subscribers. For a one-to-one handoff with buffering, SQS is preferred.

A company needs to review its AWS Cloud deployment to ensure that its Amazon S3 buckets do not have unauthorized configuration changes.

What should a solutions architect do to accomplish this goal?

- [ ] A. Turn on AWS Config with the appropriate rules.
- [ ] B. Turn on AWS Trusted Advisor with the appropriate checks.
- [ ] C. Turn on Amazon Inspector with the appropriate assessment template.
- [ ] D. Turn on Amazon S3 server access logging. Configure Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] A. Turn on AWS Config with the appropriate rules.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] AWS Config for Configuration Auditing: AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. It continuously monitors and records resource configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against desired configurations.   
- [ ] Detecting Unauthorized Changes: For Amazon S3 buckets, AWS Config can track configuration changes such as bucket policies, ACLs, versioning settings, and more. You can use AWS Config Rules (predefined or custom) to define your desired configurations (e.g., no public read access, logging enabled). If an S3 bucket configuration deviates from these rules or an unauthorized change is made, AWS Config will flag it. This directly helps in ensuring that S3 buckets "do not have unauthorized configuration changes."
- [ ] Configuration History: AWS Config maintains a history of configuration changes, which is valuable for auditing and troubleshooting.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option B is wrong because: AWS Trusted Advisor provides recommendations to help you follow AWS best practices across cost optimization, performance, security, fault tolerance, and service limits. While it may offer some checks related to S3 security (like identifying buckets with open access permissions), it's primarily a guidance tool and does not provide the continuous, detailed configuration tracking, auditing, and history features that AWS Config offers for identifying specific unauthorized changes.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that focuses on identifying vulnerabilities and deviations from best practices within your Amazon EC2 instances (e.g., checking for software vulnerabilities, network exposure). It does not monitor or audit the configurations of Amazon S3 buckets.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Amazon S3 server access logging records all requests made to an S3 bucket, which is useful for access auditing. Amazon EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events) can react to API calls made to S3. While you could potentially build a complex custom solution using these services to infer configuration changes, AWS Config is the purpose-built service for comprehensive configuration auditing and tracking with significantly less operational overhead. AWS Config provides a managed and integrated solution for this specific requirement.

A company is launching a new application and will display application metrics on an Amazon CloudWatch dashboard. The company's product manager needs to access this dashboard periodically. The product manager does not have an AWS account. A solutions architect must provide access to the product manager by following the principle of least privilege.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Share the dashboard from the CloudWatch console. Enter the product manager's email address, and complete the sharing steps. Provide a shareable link for the dashboard to the product manager.
- [ ] B. Create an IAM user specifically for the product manager. Attach the CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess AWS managed policy to the user. Share the new login credentials with the product manager. Share the browser URL of the correct dashboard with the product manager.
- [ ] C. Create an IAM user for the company's employees. Attach the ViewOnlyAccess AWS managed policy to the IAM user. Share the new login credentials with the product manager. Ask the product manager to navigate to the CloudWatch console and locate the dashboard by name in the Dashboards section.
- [ ] D. Deploy a bastion server in a public subnet. When the product manager requires access to the dashboard, start the server and share the RDP credentials. On the bastion server, ensure that the browser is configured to open the dashboard URL with cached AWS credentials that have appropriate permissions to view the dashboard.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] A. Share the dashboard from the CloudWatch console. Enter the product manager's email address, and complete the sharing steps. Provide a shareable link for the dashboard to the product manager.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] CloudWatch Dashboard Sharing Feature: Amazon CloudWatch allows you to share dashboards with individuals outside of your AWS account, including those who do not have AWS credentials. You can share a dashboard publicly (not recommended for sensitive data but possible) or with specific email addresses. The recipient receives a unique link to access the dashboard.    
- [ ] No AWS Account Required for Product Manager: This method directly addresses the constraint that "The product manager does not have an AWS account."    
- [ ] Principle of Least Privilege: Sharing a specific dashboard grants view-only access to only that dashboard's content. The product manager does not gain access to the AWS Management Console or any other AWS resources, adhering strictly to the principle of least privilege.    
- [ ] Simplicity and Low Operational Overhead: This is the simplest and most straightforward method, involving minimal configuration and no need to manage IAM users or credentials for the product manager.    

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option B is wrong because: This solution requires creating an IAM user for the product manager, which contradicts the statement that "The product manager does not have an AWS account."  While using the CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess policy is more specific than ViewOnlyAccess, the creation of an IAM user for an external party who only needs dashboard access is unnecessary overhead when a direct sharing feature exists.    
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Similar to option B, this involves creating an IAM user. Furthermore, the ViewOnlyAccess AWS managed policy grants read-only access to all AWS services and resources in the account. This is a significant violation of the principle of least privilege when the requirement is solely to view a single CloudWatch dashboard.    
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Deploying and managing a bastion server, handling RDP credentials, and relying on cached AWS credentials for browser access is an extremely complex, insecure, and operationally intensive solution for providing view-only access to a CloudWatch dashboard.  It introduces multiple potential security vulnerabilities and significant overhead.

  <summary>Question 28</summary>

A company is migrating applications to AWS. The applications are deployed in different accounts. The company manages the accounts centrally by using AWS Organizations. The company's security team needs a single sign-on (SSO) solution across all the company's accounts. The company must continue managing the users and groups in its on-premises self-managed Microsoft Active Directory.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Enable AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) from the AWS SSO console. Create a one-way forest trust or a one-way domain trust to connect the company's self-managed Microsoft Active Directory with AWS SSO by using AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory.
- [ ] B. Enable AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) from the AWS SSO console. Create a two-way forest trust to connect the company's self-managed Microsoft Active Directory with AWS SSO by using AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory.
- [ ] C. Use AWS Directory Service. Create a two-way trust relationship with the company's self-managed Microsoft Active Directory.

- [ ] B. Enable AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) from the AWS SSO console. Create a two-way forest trust to connect the company's self-managed Microsoft Active Directory with AWS SSO by using AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] AWS Single Sign-On (AWS IAM Identity Center): AWS Single Sign-On (now known as AWS IAM Identity Center) is the recommended service for centrally managing SSO access to multiple AWS accounts within an AWS Organization, as well as to business applications.
- [ ] Integration with On-Premises Active Directory: To allow users from an on-premises self-managed Microsoft Active Directory to use IAM Identity Center, you typically use AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory (AWS Managed Microsoft AD) as an intermediary.
- [ ] A trust relationship is established between your on-premises AD and the AWS Managed Microsoft AD.
- [ ] Two-Way Forest Trust: A two-way trust (either forest or domain, though forest trust is often broader) allows users and groups from the on-premises AD to be recognized and authenticated by the AWS Managed Microsoft AD. This AWS Managed Microsoft AD is then configured as the identity source for IAM Identity Center.
- [ ] This setup ensures that user and group management continues to happen in the on-premises AD, and these identities can be used to sign in via IAM Identity Center to access assigned AWS accounts and permission sets.
- [ ] The two-way nature of the trust facilitates the necessary authentication and authorization lookups.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: While a one-way trust might allow some level of authentication, a two-way trust is generally required or recommended for full functionality when integrating an on-premises AD with AWS Managed Microsoft AD for IAM Identity Center. The AWS Managed AD needs to be able to authenticate users from the on-premises AD, and users in the on-premises AD need to be able to authenticate against resources that trust the AWS Managed AD. A two-way trust typically provides more seamless integration for this scenario.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Simply creating an AWS Directory Service (e.g., AWS Managed Microsoft AD) and establishing a two-way trust with the on-premises AD allows for AD-based authentication for resources that are domain-joined or AD-aware (like specific EC2 instances). However, it does not, by itself, provide the centralized single sign-on portal and management of access across all AWS accounts in the organization that AWS IAM Identity Center offers. IAM Identity Center is the key component for SSO to AWS accounts.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: While deploying an on-premises Identity Provider (IdP) like ADFS and using SAML 2.0 federation is a valid way to achieve SSO to AWS, this option is vague about how it integrates with AWS IAM Identity Center. If the goal is to leverage IAM Identity Center's features for managing access across the AWS Organization using existing on-premises AD identities, the path involving AWS Managed Microsoft AD and a trust relationship (as described in options A and B) is a common pattern. This option also doesn't specify the connection mechanism between the on-premises IdP and AWS SSO for using on-premises AD users.

  <summary>Question 29</summary>

A company provides a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service that uses UDP connections. The service consists of Amazon EC2 instances that run in an Auto Scaling group. The company has deployments across multiple AWS Regions. The company needs to route users to the Region with the lowest latency. The company also needs automated failover between Regions.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Deploy a Network Load Balancer (NLB) and an associated target group. Associate the target group with the Auto Scaling group. Use the NLB as an AWS Global Accelerator endpoint in each Region.
- [ ] B. Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and an associated target group. Associate the target group with the Auto Scaling group. Use the ALB as an AWS Global Accelerator endpoint in each Region.
- [ ] C. Deploy a Network Load Balancer (NLB) and an associated target group. Associate the target group with the Auto Scaling group. Create an Amazon Route 53 latency record that points to aliases for each NLB. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that uses the latency record as an origin.
- [ ] D. Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and an associated target group. Associate the target group with the Auto Scaling group. Create an Amazon Route 53 weighted record that points to aliases for each ALB. Deploy an Amazon CloudFront distribution that uses the weighted record as an origin.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] A. Deploy a Network Load Balancer (NLB) and an associated target group. Associate the target group with the Auto Scaling group. Use the NLB as an AWS Global Accelerator endpoint in each Region.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Network Load Balancer (NLB) for UDP: The VoIP service uses UDP connections. NLB operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) and supports both TCP and UDP traffic, making it suitable for this use case.    
- [ ] AWS Global Accelerator for Low Latency and Failover: AWS Global Accelerator improves the availability and performance of your applications with local or global users.
- [ ] It directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network. This helps in routing users to the Region with the "lowest latency."
- [ ] Global Accelerator also provides "automated failover between Regions" by continuously monitoring the health of regional endpoints (the NLBs in this case) and routing traffic only to healthy ones.    
- [ ] NLB as Global Accelerator Endpoint: NLBs in each of the multiple AWS Regions can be configured as endpoints for Global Accelerator.  This allows Global Accelerator to manage and direct traffic to the appropriate regional deployment.   
- [ ] Auto Scaling Integration: The NLB's target group is associated with the Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances, ensuring that traffic within each region is distributed across healthy, scalable instances.    

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option B is wrong because: Application Load Balancer (ALB) operates at the application layer (Layer 7) and supports HTTP, HTTPS, and gRPC protocols. It does not support UDP traffic, which is a requirement for the VoIP service.    
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: While Amazon Route 53 latency-based routing can direct users to the region with the lowest latency, and NLB handles UDP, Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) primarily designed for caching and delivering web content (HTTP/HTTPS). It is not suitable for distributing real-time UDP traffic for a VoIP service. AWS Global Accelerator is better designed for non-HTTP use cases like UDP and for providing static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point.    
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: This option has multiple issues. As mentioned, ALB does not support UDP.  Amazon CloudFront is not suitable for UDP traffic distribution.  Also, Amazon Route 53 weighted records distribute traffic based on predefined weights, not primarily on dynamic lowest latency routing or the automated failover capabilities that Global Accelerator provides for global applications.

  <summary>Question 30</summary>

A development team runs monthly resource-intensive tests on its general purpose Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance with Performance Insights enabled. The testing lasts for 48 hours once a month and is the only process that uses the database. The team wants to reduce the cost of running the tests without reducing the compute and memory attributes of the DB instance.

Which solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

- [ ] A. Stop the DB instance when tests are completed. Restart the DB instance when required.
- [ ] B. Use an Auto Scaling policy with the DB instance to automatically scale when tests are completed.
- [ ] C. Create a snapshot when tests are completed. Terminate the DB instance and restore the snapshot when required.
- [ ] D. Modify the DB instance to a low-capacity instance when tests are completed. Modify the DB instance again when required.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] C. Create a snapshot when tests are completed. Terminate the DB instance and restore the snapshot when required.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Significant Cost Savings: The database is only used for 48 hours (2 days) a month. By creating a snapshot of the DB instance after testing, terminating the instance, and then restoring it from the snapshot before the next testing cycle, the company avoids paying for DB instance hours for the majority of the month (approximately 28 days). You only pay for the storage of the snapshot, which is significantly cheaper than running an RDS instance. This makes it the "MOST cost-effectively" solution.
- [ ] Maintains Compute and Memory Attributes: When the instance is restored from the snapshot, it can be launched with the same instance class (compute and memory attributes) as the original, ensuring that the testing environment is consistent.
- [ ] Data Preservation: The snapshot preserves all the data from the DB instance at the time the snapshot was taken.    

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: While stopping an Amazon RDS DB instance does stop billing for the instance hours, you are still billed for the provisioned storage. More critically, an RDS instance can only be stopped for a maximum of 7 consecutive days. After 7 days, AWS automatically starts the instance. Since the tests are run "once a month," this means the instance would be automatically started multiple times between tests, incurring unnecessary costs.    
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: Amazon RDS for MySQL (general purpose, not Aurora Serverless) does not have an "Auto Scaling policy" that scales the primary DB instance's compute capacity down to zero or significantly reduces its cost when idle in the way EC2 Auto Scaling does for instances. While Aurora Serverless offers compute scaling, the question refers to a "general purpose Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance."
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Modifying a DB instance to a lower-capacity instance type when tests are completed and then modifying it back before the next tests involves instance modification operations. These operations can take time and might involve downtime (though RDS attempts to minimize this for Multi-AZ instances). Furthermore, even a low-capacity instance still incurs charges for instance hours and storage throughout the month. Terminating the instance (as in option C) eliminates the instance hour charges entirely during the idle period, making it more cost-effective.

  <summary>Question 31</summary>

A company that hosts its web application on AWS wants to ensure all Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon RDS DB instances, and Amazon Redshift clusters are configured with tags.  The company wants to minimize the effort of configuring and operating this check.    

What should a solutions architect do to accomplish this?    

- [ ] A. Use AWS Config rules to define and detect resources that are not properly tagged. 
- [ ] B. Use Cost Explorer to display resources that are not properly tagged. Tag those resources manually. 
- [ ] C. Write API calls to check all resources for proper tag allocation. Periodically run the code on an EC2 instance. 
- [ ] D. Write API calls to check all resources for proper tag allocation. Schedule an AWS Lambda function through Amazon CloudWatch to periodically run the code.    

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] A. Use AWS Config rules to define and detect resources that are not properly tagged. 

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] AWS Config for Configuration Compliance: AWS Config is a service that allows you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources.  It's designed for tracking resource configurations and ensuring compliance with desired policies.   
- [ ] Config Rules for Tagging: AWS Config provides managed rules (like required-tags) and the ability to create custom rules to check whether your resources (including EC2 instances, RDS DB instances, and Redshift clusters) have the necessary tags.    
- [ ] Automated Detection and Minimal Effort: Once set up, AWS Config rules automatically and continuously evaluate your resources. If a resource is found to be non-compliant (e.g., missing required tags), AWS Config can flag it. This provides an automated way to perform the check with minimal ongoing operational effort.    

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option B is wrong because: AWS Cost Explorer is a tool for visualizing, understanding, and managing your AWS costs and usage. While it can use tags to filter cost data, it is not designed as a primary tool for detecting resources that are missing required tags for compliance purposes.  Its focus is cost analysis, not configuration auditing of tags.   
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Writing custom scripts with API calls to check for tags and running them periodically on an EC2 instance involves significant initial development effort and ongoing operational overhead for maintaining the script and the EC2 instance.  This does not minimize effort compared to using a managed service like AWS Config.   
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Similar to option C, developing custom API calls within an AWS Lambda function scheduled by Amazon CloudWatch (now Amazon EventBridge) requires custom coding and maintenance.  While serverless, it's still more effort to develop and manage than using the built-in capabilities of AWS Config, which is specifically designed for configuration compliance checks like ensuring proper tagging.

  <summary>Question 32</summary>

A development team needs to host a website that will be accessed by other teams. The website contents consist of HTML, CSS, client-side JavaScript, and images.

Which method is the MOST cost-effective for hosting the website?    

- [ ] A. Containerize the website and host it in AWS Fargate. 
- [ ] B. Create an Amazon S3 bucket and host the website there. 
- [ ] C. Deploy a web server on an Amazon EC2 instance to host the website. 
- [ ] D. Configure an Application Load Balancer with an AWS Lambda target that uses the Express.js framework.    

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] B. Create an Amazon S3 bucket and host the website there. 

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Amazon S3 for Static Website Hosting: Amazon S3 has a feature that allows you to configure a bucket to host a static website.  Since the website consists only of static content (HTML, CSS, client-side JavaScript, and images), S3 is an ideal choice.    
- [ ] MOST Cost-Effective: Hosting a static website on S3 is generally the most cost-effective option.  You primarily pay for the S3 storage consumed by your website files and the data transfer out (requests for your website content). There are no charges for compute instances, making it significantly cheaper than solutions involving EC2, Fargate, or Lambda for simple static content delivery.   
- [ ] Scalability and Durability: S3 is inherently highly scalable, durable, and available, automatically handling variations in traffic without requiring manual intervention.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Containerizing a purely static website and hosting it on AWS Fargate is an overly complex and more expensive solution.  Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers, and you would incur costs for the vCPU and memory resources allocated to your container, which is unnecessary for serving static files.   
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Deploying a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) on an Amazon EC2 instance to host a static website involves the cost of the EC2 instance running 24/7 (or on-demand), plus the operational overhead of managing the server (patching, security, updates).  This is less cost-effective and requires more management than S3 static website hosting.   
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Configuring an Application Load Balancer with an AWS Lambda target using a framework like Express.js is designed for dynamic web applications that require server-side processing.  For a website with only static content, this architecture is unnecessarily complex, has higher latency for static file delivery compared to direct S3/CloudFront, and incurs higher costs (ALB charges, Lambda invocation costs).

  <summary>Question 33</summary>

A company runs an online marketplace web application on AWS. The application serves hundreds of thousands of users during peak hours. The company needs a scalable, near-real-time solution to share the details of millions of financial transactions with several other internal applications. Transactions also need to be processed to remove sensitive data before being stored in a document database for low-latency retrieval.

What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Store the transactions data into Amazon DynamoDB. Set up a rule in DynamoDB to remove sensitive data from every transaction upon write. Use DynamoDB Streams to share the transactions data with other applications.
- [ ] B. Stream the transactions data into Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to store data in Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon S3. Use AWS Lambda integration with Kinesis Data Firehose to remove sensitive data. Other applications can consume the data stored in Amazon S3.
- [ ] C. Stream the transactions data into Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Use AWS Lambda integration to remove sensitive data from every transaction and then store the transactions data in Amazon DynamoDB. Other applications can consume the transactions data off the Kinesis data stream.
- [ ] D. Store the batched transactions data in Amazon S3 as files. Use AWS Lambda to process every file and remove sensitive data before updating the files in Amazon S3. The Lambda function then stores the data in Amazon DynamoDB. Other applications can consume transaction files stored in Amazon S3.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] C. Stream the transactions data into Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Use AWS Lambda integration to remove sensitive data from every transaction and then store the transactions data in Amazon DynamoDB. Other applications can consume the transactions data off the Kinesis data stream.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Scalable, Near-Real-Time Ingestion with Kinesis Data Streams: Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is designed for ingesting and processing large volumes of streaming data in near real-time. It can handle "millions of financial transactions" from a high-traffic application.
- [ ] Data Processing with Lambda: Kinesis Data Streams integrates seamlessly with AWS Lambda. A Lambda function can be configured to consume records from the stream, perform transformations like "remove sensitive data," and then pass the cleaned data to other services.
- [ ] Low-Latency Storage with DynamoDB: After processing, the Lambda function can store the sanitized transaction data in Amazon DynamoDB. DynamoDB is a NoSQL document database that provides "low-latency retrieval" and scales to handle high throughput, suitable for serving data to applications.
- [ ] Sharing with Multiple Applications: "Several other internal applications" can be configured as independent consumers of the Kinesis data stream. They can read and process the transaction data (either raw or after some initial processing by a primary Lambda) in parallel and at their own pace, providing a flexible and scalable way to share data.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: DynamoDB itself does not have built-in "rules" to remove sensitive data upon write in the manner described. While you can use DynamoDB Streams to trigger a Lambda function after data is written to perform transformations, this means sensitive data would first be stored in DynamoDB before being processed. Kinesis Data Streams with Lambda allows processing before it hits the final document database.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is primarily a data delivery service designed to load streaming data into destinations like S3, Redshift, or Amazon OpenSearch Service. While it supports data transformation via Lambda, it's less suited for providing a persistent stream that "several other internal applications" can consume in near real-time for varied purposes compared to Kinesis Data Streams. Consuming from S3 (as suggested for other applications) introduces batch latency rather than near-real-time stream processing.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Storing "batched transactions data in Amazon S3 as files" and then processing these files with Lambda is a batch processing approach, not a "scalable, near-real-time solution" suitable for handling millions of individual financial transactions that need to be shared quickly. This method introduces inherent latency due to batching and file processing.

A company hosts its multi-tier applications on AWS. For compliance, governance, auditing, and security, the company must track configuration changes on its AWS resources and record a history of API calls made to these resources.    

What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Use AWS CloudTrail to track configuration changes and AWS Config to record API calls. 
- [ ] B. Use AWS Config to track configuration changes and AWS CloudTrail to record API calls. 
- [ ] C. Use AWS Config to track configuration changes and Amazon CloudWatch to record API calls. 
- [ ] D. Use AWS CloudTrail to track configuration changes and Amazon CloudWatch to record API calls.    

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] B. Use AWS Config to track configuration changes and AWS CloudTrail to record API calls. 

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] AWS Config for Tracking Configuration Changes: AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. It continuously monitors AWS resource configurations and maintains a history of configuration changes.
- [ ] This directly addresses the requirement to "track configuration changes on its AWS resources."    
- [ ] AWS CloudTrail for Recording API Call History: AWS CloudTrail records user activity and API calls made to AWS services.
- [ ] These logs provide a detailed history of actions taken in your AWS account, including who made the API call, when it was made, from what IP address, and what resources were affected.
- [ ] This directly addresses the requirement to "record a history of API calls made to these resources."    

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: This option reverses the primary roles of the two services. AWS CloudTrail is for recording API calls, and AWS Config is for tracking configuration changes.    
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: While Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service and can store logs (including CloudTrail logs), it is not the primary service for recording a comprehensive history of API calls for auditing and governance purposes; that is the role of AWS CloudTrail.    
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: This option incorrectly assigns the roles. AWS CloudTrail tracks API calls, not primarily configuration changes (which is AWS Config's strength). Amazon CloudWatch is for monitoring and does not replace CloudTrail for API call history for audit purposes.

A company is preparing to launch a public-facing web application in the AWS Cloud. The architecture consists of Amazon EC2 instances within a VPC behind an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).  A third-party service is used for the DNS. The company's solutions architect must recommend a solution to detect and protect against large-scale DDoS attacks.    

Which solution meets these requirements?

- [ ] A. Enable Amazon GuardDuty on the account. 
- [ ] B. Enable Amazon Inspector on the EC2 instances. 
- [ ] C. Enable AWS Shield and assign Amazon Route 53 to it. 
- [ ] D. Enable AWS Shield Advanced and assign the ELB to it.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] D. Enable AWS Shield Advanced and assign the ELB to it. 

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] AWS Shield Advanced for Enhanced DDoS Protection: AWS Shield Advanced offers a higher level of protection against larger and more sophisticated Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks compared to AWS Shield Standard (which provides default protection). For "large-scale DDoS attacks," Shield Advanced is the appropriate service.    
- [ ] Protecting the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): The ELB is the entry point for traffic to the web application.  Protecting the ELB with Shield Advanced ensures that volumetric network layer attacks and other types of DDoS attacks targeting the application's frontend are mitigated.    
- [ ] Detection and Mitigation: Shield Advanced provides detection of DDoS attacks and includes automatic inline mitigations for many common infrastructure (Layer 3 and 4) attacks. For application layer (Layer 7) attacks, it integrates with AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall), allowing you to create custom rules for mitigation. Shield Advanced also provides access to the AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT) for expert assistance during an attack.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that monitors for malicious or unauthorized behavior within your AWS environment.  While it might detect activity related to a DDoS attack (e.g., if instances are compromised and participating in an attack, or if there are unusual traffic patterns), GuardDuty itself is not a DDoS mitigation service; it provides alerts and findings, but AWS Shield is designed for DDoS protection.   
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: Amazon Inspector is a vulnerability management service that scans your EC2 instances for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.  It helps improve the security posture of your instances but does not provide real-time protection against incoming DDoS attacks.   
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: All AWS customers benefit from AWS Shield Standard protection automatically and at no additional cost. This option mentions enabling "AWS Shield," which likely refers to Shield Standard. While Route 53 can be a target for DNS-based DDoS attacks, and Shield Advanced can protect Route 53 hosted zones, the primary concern for application availability during a large-scale DDoS attack is typically the application endpoint, which in this architecture is the ELB.  Shield Advanced provides more robust protection than Shield Standard and should be associated directly with the application entry points like the ELB for comprehensive protection against attacks aimed at overwhelming the application servers.

  <summary>Question 36</summary>

A company is building an application in the AWS Cloud. The application will store data in Amazon S3 buckets in two AWS Regions. The company must use an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key to encrypt all data that is stored in the S3 buckets. The data in both S3 buckets must be encrypted and decrypted with the same KMS key. The data and the key must be stored in each of the two Regions.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- [ ] A. Create an S3 bucket in each Region. Configure the S3 buckets to use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). Configure replication between the S3 buckets.
- [ ] B. Create a customer managed multi-Region KMS key. Create an S3 bucket in each Region. Configure replication between the S3 buckets. Configure the application to use the KMS key with client-side encryption.
- [ ] C. Create a customer managed KMS key and an S3 bucket in each Region. Configure the S3 buckets to use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). Configure replication between the S3 buckets.
- [ ] D. Create a customer managed KMS key and an S3 bucket in each Region. Configure the S3 buckets to use server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS). Configure replication between the S3 buckets.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] B. Create a customer managed multi-Region KMS key. Create an S3 bucket in each Region. Configure replication between the S3 buckets. Configure the application to use the KMS key with client-side encryption.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Customer Managed Multi-Region KMS Key: The requirement is to use the same AWS KMS customer managed key for encrypting and decrypting data in S3 buckets across two AWS Regions. AWS KMS multi-Region keys are designed for this.
- [ ] A multi-Region key has the same key ID and key material in all specified Regions, allowing data encrypted in one Region to be decrypted in another using the same logical key.    
- [ ] Key and Data Stored in Each Region: Multi-Region keys are replicated and thus "stored" in each of the designated Regions.  S3 buckets are regional, so the data is stored in each respective Region.    
- [ ] Client-Side Encryption: To ensure the data is encrypted with this specific multi-Region KMS key before it's written to S3 in either Region, and to allow the application to use this same key for decryption regardless of the S3 bucket's region, client-side encryption is employed.
- [ ] The application uses the AWS KMS SDK to interact with the multi-Region KMS key for encryption (before upload) and decryption (after download).    
- [ ] Least Operational Overhead (from a key consistency perspective): While client-side encryption adds some complexity to the application code, the use of a multi-Region KMS key simplifies ensuring that the exact same encryption key (material and ID) is used across regions.
- [ ] This avoids the complexity of managing separate regional keys and trying to ensure interoperability or consistent encryption policies if using server-side encryption with regional keys. The operational overhead of creating and managing a multi-Region key itself is relatively low.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: It specifies using server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3).  The requirement is to use a "customer managed key." SSE-S3 does not meet this.   
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: This option is contradictory. It mentions creating a customer managed KMS key but then configuring the S3 buckets to use SSE-S3 (S3 managed keys).  These are different encryption methods. If a customer managed KMS key is to be used with server-side encryption, it would be SSE-KMS.   
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: If "a customer managed KMS key" refers to a standard, regional KMS key created independently in each Region, then these would be different keys, and data encrypted with one could not be decrypted by the other. This would not meet the requirement that "data in both S3 buckets must be encrypted and decrypted with the same KMS key."  While S3 replication with SSE-KMS can work, if the keys in each region are distinct regional keys, the "same key" criteria isn't met. If this option implied using a single multi-Region key with SSE-KMS, it could be viable; however, client-side encryption (Option B) gives the application more direct control to ensure the same key is used for the cryptographic operations across regions before data lands in S3.

A company recently launched a variety of new workloads on Amazon EC2 instances in its AWS account. The company needs to create a strategy to access and administer the instances remotely and securely. The company needs to implement a repeatable process that works with native AWS services and follows the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- [ ] A. Use the EC2 serial console to directly access the terminal interface of each instance for administration.
- [ ] B. Attach the appropriate IAM role to each existing instance and new instance. Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to establish a remote SSH session.
- [ ] C. Create an administrative SSH key pair. Load the public key into each EC2 instance. Deploy a bastion host in a public subnet to provide a tunnel for administration of each instance.
- [ ] D. Establish an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. Instruct administrators to use their local on-premises machines to connect directly to the instances by using SSH keys across the VPN tunnel.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] B. Attach the appropriate IAM role to each existing instance and new instance. Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to establish a remote SSH session.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] AWS Systems Manager Session Manager: Session Manager is a fully managed AWS service that provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound SSH (port 22) or RDP (port 3389) ports, manage bastion hosts, or maintain SSH keys. This significantly enhances security and reduces operational overhead.
- [ ] IAM Role for Access Control: Access to instances via Session Manager is controlled through AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies. This allows for granular permissions, adherence to the principle of least privilege, and a repeatable process for granting access. This aligns well with the AWS Well-Architected Framework's security pillar.
- [ ] Native AWS Service and Low Overhead: Session Manager is a native AWS service, ensuring good integration and support. It eliminates the overhead associated with patching and maintaining bastion hosts, managing SSH key pairs, or configuring VPNs solely for instance administration. Commands and session activity can also be logged to services like S3 or CloudWatch Logs for auditing.
- [ ] Secure Remote Sessions: Session Manager allows users to start secure shell (SSH) or PowerShell sessions to instances directly from the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or via the AWS SDK.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: The EC2 serial console is primarily a troubleshooting tool for instances that are unreachable via normal SSH or RDP (e.g., due to boot issues or network misconfigurations). It is not intended or suitable as a primary method for routine remote administration of a fleet of instances. It offers limited functionality compared to a full shell session.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Managing SSH key pairs (distribution, rotation, revocation) and deploying, maintaining, and securing bastion hosts introduces significant operational overhead and potential security risks. Bastion hosts themselves need to be patched and monitored, and SSH keys can be compromised. Session Manager (Option B) avoids these complexities.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: While an AWS Site-to-Site VPN provides secure connectivity between an on-premises network and a VPC, it is primarily for network extension. Relying on it for instance administration still requires managing SSH keys for individual instances. Session Manager offers a more direct, instance-level access control method that doesn't depend on network-level VPNs and enhances security by not requiring open SSH ports on the instances themselves or direct SSH key management for session access. It is generally a more streamlined solution for secure instance access within AWS.

- [ ] C. Add an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of the S3 bucket. Edit the Route 53 entries to point to the CloudFront distribution.
- [ ] D. Enable S3 Transfer Acceleration on the bucket. Edit the Route 53 entries to point to the new endpoint.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] C. Add an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of the S3 bucket. Edit the Route 53 entries to point to the CloudFront distribution.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Amazon CloudFront for Low-Latency Content Delivery: Amazon CloudFront is AWS's content delivery network (CDN).
- [ ] It caches copies of your static website content (from the S3 origin) at edge locations distributed globally.
- [ ] When users request content, they are served from the nearest edge location, which significantly "decreases latency."
- [ ] Integration with S3 and Route 53: CloudFront is designed to work seamlessly with Amazon S3 as an origin for static websites.
- [ ] After setting up the CloudFront distribution, you update your Amazon Route 53 DNS record for your website's domain to point to the CloudFront distribution's domain name.
- [ ] MOST Cost-Effective for Static Websites: For delivering static website content globally with low latency, CloudFront is generally the most cost-effective solution. It reduces the load on your S3 origin and optimizes data transfer costs by serving content from edge locations. The pricing model is typically well-suited for website delivery.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Replicating an S3 bucket to all AWS Regions using S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) would incur significant storage costs (paying for storage in every region) and data transfer costs for replication. Managing this setup would also have higher operational overhead. While Route 53 geolocation routing could direct users to a nearby regional bucket, CloudFront provides a more extensive network of edge locations and is generally more cost-effective and simpler for caching and delivering static content.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: AWS Global Accelerator is designed to improve the performance and availability of global applications by providing static IP addresses and routing user traffic over the AWS global network to optimal regional endpoints. While it can reduce latency for applications, CloudFront is more specifically tailored and usually more cost-effective for caching and delivering static website content from S3. Global Accelerator does not provide the same level of edge caching as CloudFront, which is key for static content latency reduction.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: S3 Transfer Acceleration is primarily designed to speed up uploads of data to Amazon S3 over long distances by routing traffic through Amazon CloudFront's edge locations. It does not provide the same benefits for downloading or serving static website content with caching at edge locations to global users as a full CloudFront distribution does. For reducing latency for users accessing a website, a CloudFront distribution is the appropriate service.

  <summary>Question 39</summary>

A company maintains a searchable repository of items on its website. The data is stored in an Amazon RDS for MySQL database table that contains more than 10 million rows. The database has 2 TB of General Purpose SSD storage. There are millions of updates against this data every day through the company's website. The company has noticed that some insert operations are taking 10 seconds or longer. The company has determined that the database storage performance is the problem.

Which solution addresses this performance issue?

- [ ] A. Change the storage type to Provisioned IOPS SSD.
- [ ] B. Change the DB instance to a memory optimized instance class.
- [ ] C. Change the DB instance to a burstable performance instance class.
- [ ] D. Enable Multi-AZ RDS read replicas with MySQL native asynchronous replication.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] A. Change the storage type to Provisioned IOPS SSD.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Identified Bottleneck is Storage Performance: The question explicitly states, "The company has determined that the database storage performance is the problem."
- [ ] General Purpose SSD vs. Provisioned IOPS SSD:
- [ ] Amazon RDS General Purpose SSD (gp2 and gp3) volumes deliver a baseline IOPS performance that scales with storage size and offer the ability to burst IOPS.
- [ ] For a database with "millions of updates every day" and slow insert operations (10 seconds or longer), it's likely that the current General Purpose SSD storage is hitting its IOPS or throughput limits.
- [ ] Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1, io2, io2 Block Express) volumes are designed for critical, I/O-intensive database workloads that require sustained high performance and low latency.
- [ ] You can specify a consistent amount of IOPS when you create the volume. Changing to Provisioned IOPS SSD directly targets the identified storage performance bottleneck by providing a higher and more consistent level of I/O operations per second.
- [ ] Addresses Slow Inserts: Slow insert operations are a common symptom of storage I/O contention. Upgrading the storage to a higher-performance tier like Provisioned IOPS SSD will provide the necessary throughput to handle the millions of daily updates more efficiently.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option B is wrong because: While increasing memory by changing to a memory-optimized instance class can improve database performance by allowing more data to be cached, the problem specifically states that "database storage performance is the problem." If the bottleneck is the disk's ability to handle I/O operations, adding more memory alone will not resolve the slow insert times caused by I/O limitations.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Burstable performance instance classes (like db.t3 or db.t4g for RDS) provide a baseline CPU performance with the ability to burst. The identified issue is with storage performance, not CPU. Moreover, a database handling "millions of updates every day" is likely to require sustained performance that would quickly deplete CPU credits on a burstable instance, leading to further performance degradation.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Multi-AZ deployments for RDS provide high availability and data durability by creating a standby replica. Read replicas are used to offload read traffic from the primary database instance. While read replicas can improve overall application performance by handling read queries, they do not directly improve the performance of write operations (like inserts) on the primary instance. Since the issue is with slow insert operations and the bottleneck is storage performance on the primary, this solution doesn't address the root cause.

  <summary>Question 40</summary>

A company has thousands of edge devices that collectively generate 1 TB of status alerts each day. Each alert is approximately 2 KB in size. A solutions architect needs to implement a solution to ingest and store the alerts for future analysis. The company wants a highly available solution. However, the company needs to minimize costs and does not want to manage additional infrastructure. Additionally, the company wants to keep 14 days of data available for immediate analysis and archive any data older than 14 days.   

What is the MOST operationally efficient solution that meets these requirements?

- [ ] A. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to ingest the alerts. Configure the Kinesis Data Firehose stream to deliver the alerts to an Amazon S3 bucket. Set up an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition data to Amazon S3 Glacier after 14 days. 
- [ ] B. Launch Amazon EC2 instances across two Availability Zones and place them behind an Elastic Load Balancer to ingest the alerts. Create a script on the EC2 instances that will store the alerts in an Amazon S3 bucket. Set up an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition data to Amazon S3 Glacier after 14 days. 
- [ ] C. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to ingest the alerts. Configure the Kinesis Data Firehose stream to deliver the alerts to an Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) cluster. Set up the Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) cluster to take manual snapshots every day and delete data from the cluster that is older than 14 days. 
- [ ] D. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue to ingest the alerts, and set the message retention period to 14 days. Configure consumers to poll the SQS queue, check the age of the message, and analyze the message data as needed. If the message is 14 days old, the consumer should copy the message to an Amazon S3 bucket and delete the message from the SQS queue.    

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] A. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to ingest the alerts. Configure the Kinesis Data Firehose stream to deliver the alerts to an Amazon S3 bucket. Set up an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition data to Amazon S3 Glacier after 14 days. 

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Managed Ingestion with Kinesis Data Firehose: Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is a fully managed service for capturing, transforming, and loading streaming data. It can easily handle the 1 TB of alerts generated daily without requiring the company to manage any underlying infrastructure, thus meeting the "does not want to manage additional infrastructure" and "MOST operationally efficient" requirements.  It is also highly available.   
- [ ] Cost-Effective Storage with S3: Firehose can deliver the incoming alerts directly to an Amazon S3 bucket. S3 provides durable, scalable, and cost-effective storage for the alerts. Data stored in S3 for the initial 14 days can be easily accessed for "immediate analysis" using query services like Amazon Athena.   
- [ ] Automated Archival with S3 Lifecycle: An S3 Lifecycle configuration can be set up to automatically transition objects older than 14 days from the S3 standard storage class to a cheaper archival storage class like Amazon S3 Glacier (or S3 Glacier Deep Archive for even lower costs if retrieval times are flexible). This addresses the archival requirement and helps "minimize costs."   
- [ ] Overall Efficiency: This solution uses serverless and managed services, which greatly reduces operational burden.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option B is wrong because: This solution involves managing EC2 instances, an Elastic Load Balancer, and custom scripts for ingestion. This directly contradicts the requirement to "not want to manage additional infrastructure" and is less operationally efficient than a managed service like Kinesis Data Firehose.   
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: While Amazon OpenSearch Service is suitable for analyzing log data, managing an OpenSearch cluster (even a managed one) generally incurs higher costs and more operational overhead compared to storing data in S3 and querying it with Athena for this use case, especially when cost minimization is a goal. The process of taking manual snapshots and manually deleting old data from OpenSearch is also less operationally efficient than an automated S3 Lifecycle policy.   
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Using Amazon SQS with a 14-day message retention period  and then relying on consumers to manually check message age, analyze, and then copy to S3 for archival is a complex and potentially error-prone process. This solution is not as operationally efficient or robust for ingesting and archiving 1 TB of data daily compared to using Kinesis Data Firehose for direct S3 delivery and S3 Lifecycle policies for archival. It also places a significant burden on the consumer logic.

  <summary>Question 41</summary>
  
A company's application integrates with multiple software-as-a-service (SaaS) sources for data collection.  The company runs Amazon EC2 instances to receive the data and to upload the data to an Amazon S3 bucket for analysis.  The same EC2 instance that receives and uploads the data also sends a notification to the user when an upload is complete.  The company has noticed slow application performance and wants to improve the performance as much as possible.    

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?    

- [ ] A. Create an Auto Scaling group so that EC2 instances can scale out.  Configure an S3 event notification to send events to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the upload to the S3 bucket is complete. 
- [ ] B. Create an Amazon AppFlow flow to transfer data between each SaaS source and the S3 bucket.  Configure an S3 event notification to send events to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the upload to the S3 bucket is complete. 
- [ ] C. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule for each SaaS source to send output data.  Configure the S3 bucket as the rule's target. Create a second EventBridge (Cloud Watch Events) rule to send events when the upload to the S3 bucket is complete.  Configure an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic as the second rule's target. 
- [ ] D. Create a Docker container to use instead of an EC2 instance.  Host the containerized application on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS).  Configure Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights to send events to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the upload to the S3 bucket is complete.    

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] B. Create an Amazon AppFlow flow to transfer data between each SaaS source and the S3 bucket.  Configure an S3 event notification to send events to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the upload to the S3 bucket is complete. 

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Amazon AppFlow for SaaS Data Integration: Amazon AppFlow is a fully managed integration service designed to securely transfer data between SaaS applications (like Salesforce, Marketo, Zendesk, etc.) and AWS services such as Amazon S3.  Using AppFlow automates the data collection and transfer from multiple SaaS sources to the S3 bucket, removing the need for the custom EC2 instances to perform this task. This directly addresses the performance issues related to the EC2 instances and significantly reduces operational overhead by replacing custom code and infrastructure with a managed service.   
- [ ] Decoupled Notifications with S3 Events and SNS: The solution also leverages S3 event notifications to trigger an Amazon SNS topic when data uploads to S3 are complete.  This decouples the notification process from the data ingestion process, which is a best practice. It ensures that notifications are handled efficiently and reliably without impacting the data transfer.   
- [ ] Improved Performance and Least Operational Overhead: By offloading the data transfer to the managed AppFlow service and handling notifications asynchronously through S3 events and SNS, the existing EC2 instances' responsibilities are greatly reduced or eliminated. This leads to improved performance (as AppFlow is optimized for these transfers) and the "LEAST operational overhead" since you're no longer managing custom data collection scripts on EC2 instances.    

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: While adding Auto Scaling to the EC2 instances might help handle more load, it doesn't fundamentally solve the inefficiency or potential bottlenecks in the custom data collection and notification logic running on those instances.  It still retains the higher operational overhead of managing EC2 instances for this task compared to a managed service like AppFlow. The notification part is good, but the data collection is not optimized for operational overhead.    
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Using Amazon EventBridge to have SaaS sources directly send data to S3 might not be feasible or directly supported by many SaaS applications, which often rely on API-based integration or specific connectors that AppFlow provides.  AppFlow is purpose-built for these SaaS integrations. While EventBridge is excellent for event-driven architectures and can react to S3 events for notifications, its role in directly pulling from diverse SaaS sources is limited compared to AppFlow.   
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Migrating the application to Docker containers on Amazon ECS addresses how the application is deployed and managed but doesn't necessarily change the underlying custom logic for data collection from SaaS sources.  It might not reduce the operational overhead related to the data integration itself as much as AppFlow would. Using CloudWatch Container Insights for notifications based on S3 uploads is also less direct than using S3 event notifications.

  <summary>Question 42</summary>

A company runs a highly available image-processing application on Amazon EC2 instances in a single VPC. The EC2 instances run inside several subnets across multiple Availability Zones. The EC2 instances do not communicate with each other. However, the EC2 instances download images from Amazon S3 and upload images to Amazon S3 through a single NAT gateway. The company is concerned about data transfer charges.

What is the MOST cost-effective way for the company to avoid Regional data transfer charges?    

- [ ] A. Launch the NAT gateway in each Availability Zone. 
- [ ] B. Replace the NAT gateway with a NAT instance. 
- [ ] C. Deploy a gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3. 
- [ ] D. Provision an EC2 Dedicated Host to run the EC2 instances.    

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] C. Deploy a gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3. 

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Avoiding NAT Gateway Charges for S3 Traffic: When EC2 instances in a private subnet access Amazon S3 through a NAT gateway, you incur charges for the data processed by the NAT gateway.    
- [ ] Gateway VPC Endpoint for S3: A gateway VPC endpoint provides a private connection from your VPC to Amazon S3. Traffic between your EC2 instances and S3 routes through the endpoint within the AWS network, without needing to go through a NAT gateway or an internet gateway.    
- [ ] Cost-Effectiveness: There are no hourly charges for using gateway VPC endpoints. More importantly, data transferred between EC2 instances and Amazon S3 through a gateway endpoint within the same AWS Region does not incur data transfer charges or NAT gateway processing charges.
- [ ] This directly addresses the company's concern about data transfer charges and is the most cost-effective solution for this scenario.   

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Launching a NAT gateway in each Availability Zone is a strategy for high availability of internet access from private subnets. However, it would increase costs because you pay an hourly charge for each NAT gateway and for the data it processes. It does not avoid the data processing charges associated with accessing S3 through a NAT gateway.    
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: Replacing a managed NAT gateway with a NAT instance (an EC2 instance configured to perform NAT) might change the cost structure (paying for EC2 instance hours instead of NAT gateway hours). However, data transferred to S3 via a NAT instance would still effectively be routed out and back in, and you'd still have data transfer costs associated with the EC2 instance. It also increases operational overhead compared to a managed NAT gateway and does not eliminate S3 access costs as effectively as a gateway endpoint.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Provisioning an EC2 Dedicated Host is about having dedicated physical servers for your EC2 instances, typically for software licensing compliance or specific performance/isolation needs. It has no bearing on how data is transferred to or from Amazon S3 or the associated data transfer charges.

  <summary>Question 43</summary>

A company has an on-premises application that generates a large amount of time-sensitive data that is backed up to Amazon S3.  The application has grown and there are user complaints about internet bandwidth limitations.  A solutions architect needs to design a long-term solution that allows for both timely backups to Amazon S3 and with minimal impact on internet connectivity for internal users.    

Which solution meets these requirements?

- [ ] A. Establish AWS VPN connections and proxy all traffic through a VPC gateway endpoint. 
- [ ] B. Establish a new AWS Direct Connect connection and direct backup traffic through this new connection. 
- [ ] C. Order daily AWS Snowball devices. Load the data onto the Snowball devices and return the devices to AWS each day. 
- [ ] D. Submit a support ticket through the AWS Management Console. Request the removal of S3 service limits from the account.    

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] B. Establish a new AWS Direct Connect connection and direct backup traffic through this new connection.  

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] AWS Direct Connect for Dedicated Bandwidth: AWS Direct Connect establishes a dedicated, private network connection from your on-premises data center to AWS.  This connection does not traverse the public internet.   
- [ ] Minimal Impact on Existing Internet: By directing the large volume of backup traffic to Amazon S3 over the Direct Connect link, the company's existing internet connection is freed up.  This addresses the "user complaints about internet bandwidth limitations" by separating backup traffic from general internet usage.    
- [ ] Timely and Consistent Backups: Direct Connect provides high bandwidth and consistent network performance, which is crucial for "timely backups" of "large amount of time-sensitive data."    
- [ ] Long-Term Solution: Establishing a Direct Connect connection is a robust "long-term solution" for persistent, high-bandwidth requirements between an on-premises environment and AWS.    

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: An AWS VPN connection, while secure, typically routes traffic over the existing public internet connection.  This would still consume the company's internet bandwidth and would not alleviate the "internet bandwidth limitations" for other users.  A VPC gateway endpoint for S3 facilitates private access to S3 from within a VPC, not directly from an on-premises location over a VPN in a way that solves the internet bandwidth contention.    
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Ordering AWS Snowball devices daily for backing up time-sensitive data is operationally very cumbersome and not suitable as a "long-term solution" for regular backups.  Snowball is better suited for large, one-time data migrations or for environments with extremely limited or no network connectivity.  The daily logistics would be a significant burden.   
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: The problem explicitly states "internet bandwidth limitations" as the issue.  S3 service limits (e.g., on request rates or bucket numbers) are generally very high and are unlikely to be the cause of slow backups when internet bandwidth is constrained. Requesting an increase in S3 service limits would not address the core problem of insufficient network capacity on the company's internet connection.

  <summary>Question 44</summary>

A company has an Amazon S3 bucket that contains critical data. The company must protect the data from accidental deletion.    

Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

- [ ] A. Enable versioning on the S3 bucket. 
- [ ] B. Enable MFA Delete on the S3 bucket. 
- [ ] C. Create a bucket policy on the S3 bucket.
- [ ] D. Enable default encryption on the S3 bucket. 
- [ ] E. Create a lifecycle policy for the objects in the S3 bucket.    

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] A. Enable versioning on the S3 bucket. 
- [ ] B. Enable MFA Delete on the S3 bucket. 

Why these are the correct answers:

A. Enable versioning on the S3 bucket.
- [ ] Protection Against Accidental Deletion/Overwrite: S3 Versioning keeps multiple versions of an object in the same bucket. When an object is "deleted" in a versioning-enabled bucket, Amazon S3 inserts a delete marker for that object instead of permanently removing it.
- [ ] This delete marker becomes the current version. If an object is overwritten, the new version becomes the current version, and the previous version is retained.
- [ ] This allows you to easily recover from accidental deletions (by deleting the delete marker) or accidental overwrites (by restoring a previous version).    

B. Enable MFA Delete on the S3 bucket.
- [ ] Enhanced Protection for Deletion Operations: MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) Delete adds an extra layer of security specifically for deletion operations in a versioning-enabled bucket.
- [ ] When MFA Delete is enabled, certain operations, such as permanently deleting an object version or changing the versioning state of the bucket, require the bucket owner to provide their standard AWS credentials plus a valid code from their MFA device.
- [ ] This significantly reduces the risk of accidental deletions, even by users with delete permissions, as it requires an additional, out-of-band authentication step.    

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] C. Create a bucket policy on the S3 bucket.
While a bucket policy is crucial for controlling access and can be used to deny delete permissions to certain users or roles, it doesn't inherently protect against accidental deletion by an authorized user who makes a mistake. Versioning and MFA Delete provide mechanisms to recover from or add an extra check to the deletion action itself. A bucket policy is about preventing unauthorized actions, while versioning/MFA Delete are about mitigating the impact of (potentially authorized but accidental) actions.
- [ ] D. Enable default encryption on the S3 bucket.
Default encryption ensures that all new objects stored in the S3 bucket are encrypted at rest. This protects the confidentiality of the data from unauthorized access to the underlying storage. However, encryption does not prevent objects from being deleted. It's a data protection measure for confidentiality, not for preventing accidental deletion.    
- [ ] E. Create a lifecycle policy for the objects in the S3 bucket.
S3 Lifecycle policies are used to manage the lifetime of objects in a bucket by automating their transition to different storage classes or their expiration (deletion). While useful for cost optimization and data retention management, a misconfigured lifecycle policy could inadvertently cause data to be deleted. It is not primarily a mechanism to protect against accidental, ad-hoc deletions by users.

  <summary>Question 45</summary>
  
A company has a data ingestion workflow that consists of the following:

An Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic for notifications about new data deliveries
An AWS Lambda function to process the data and record metadata
The company observes that the ingestion workflow fails occasionally because of network connectivity issues. When such a failure occurs, the Lambda function does not ingest the corresponding data unless the company manually reruns the job.

Which combination of actions should a solutions architect take to ensure that the Lambda function ingests all data in the future? (Choose two.)

- [ ] A. Deploy the Lambda function in multiple Availability Zones.
- [ ] B. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue, and subscribe it to the SNS topic.
- [ ] C. Increase the CPU and memory that are allocated to the Lambda function.
- [ ] D. Increase provisioned throughput for the Lambda function.
- [ ] E. Modify the Lambda function to read from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] B. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue, and subscribe it to the SNS topic.
- [ ] E. Modify the Lambda function to read from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.

Why these are the correct answers:

This combination creates a more resilient and reliable data ingestion workflow:

B. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue, and subscribe it to the SNS topic.
- [ ] Decoupling and Durability: SNS is great for fanning out messages, but if a direct Lambda subscriber fails transiently (due to "network connectivity issues"), the message might be lost or retries exhausted without successful processing.
- [ ] By inserting an SQS queue between SNS and Lambda, the messages sent by SNS are first delivered to the SQS queue. SQS provides durable message storage, acting as a buffer.
- [ ] If the Lambda function is temporarily unable to process, the messages remain safely in the queue.

E. Modify the Lambda function to read from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.
- [ ] Reliable Processing and Retries: When the Lambda function is configured to use the SQS queue as its event source, it will poll the queue for messages.
- [ ] If the Lambda function fails to process a message (e.g., due to a temporary network issue when trying to record metadata), the message can remain in the SQS queue (based on its visibility timeout) and be attempted again.
- [ ] SQS also supports configuring a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) to send messages that consistently fail processing after a certain number of retries, allowing for investigation without losing the message.
- [ ] This setup ensures that messages are not lost due to transient failures and that the Lambda function has a better chance to "ingest all data."

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: AWS Lambda functions automatically run in a highly available environment managed by AWS, which spans multiple Availability Zones. You do not manually deploy Lambda functions to specific AZs in the way you might for EC2 instances. The problem described is about handling transient processing failures and message loss, not about the inherent availability of the Lambda service itself.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: While increasing CPU or memory might help if the Lambda function was failing due to resource exhaustion during its processing, the problem states the failures are "because of network connectivity issues." Simply increasing Lambda resources won't solve external network problems or ensure that a message that failed to process due to such an issue is reliably retried and eventually processed.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: The term "provisioned throughput" is not directly applicable to AWS Lambda in the context of ensuring message ingestion from SNS or SQS. Lambda scales its execution based on the number of incoming events (or messages polled from a queue). While you can set "Provisioned Concurrency" for Lambda to keep a certain number of execution environments warm and reduce cold starts, it doesn't address the core issue of message durability and retries when failures occur due to external factors like network connectivity. The problem is about not losing data when a single invocation fails.

A company has an application that provides marketing services to stores. The services are based on previous purchases by store customers. The stores upload transaction data to the company through SFTP, and the data is processed and analyzed to generate new marketing offers. Some of the files can exceed 200 GB in size.

Recently, the company discovered that some of the stores have uploaded files that contain personally identifiable information (PII) that should not have been included. The company wants administrators to be alerted if PII is shared again. The company also wants to automate remediation.

What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST development effort?

- [ ] A. Use an Amazon S3 bucket as a secure transfer point. Use Amazon Inspector to scan the objects in the bucket. If objects contain PII, trigger an S3 Lifecycle policy to remove the objects that contain PII.
- [ ] B. Use an Amazon S3 bucket as a secure transfer point. Use Amazon Macie to scan the objects in the bucket. If objects contain PII, use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to trigger a notification to the administrators to remove the objects that contain PII.
- [ ] C. Implement custom scanning algorithms in an AWS Lambda function. Trigger the function when objects are loaded into the bucket. If objects contain PII, use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to trigger a notification to the administrators to remove the objects that contain PII.
- [ ] D. Implement custom scanning algorithms in an AWS Lambda function. Trigger the function when objects are loaded into the bucket. If objects contain PII, use Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to trigger a notification to the administrators and trigger an S3 Lifecycle policy to remove the meats that contain PII.

- [ ] B. Use an Amazon S3 bucket as a secure transfer point. Use Amazon Macie to scan the objects in the bucket. If objects contain PII, use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to trigger a notification to the administrators to remove the objects that contain PII.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Amazon S3 as Secure Transfer Point: Using an S3 bucket as the destination for SFTP uploads is a common and secure approach. (Often AWS Transfer Family is used for the SFTP frontend to S3).
- [ ] Amazon Macie for PII Detection: Amazon Macie is a fully managed data security and data privacy service that uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover and protect sensitive data, such as PII, in Amazon S3. This directly addresses the need to identify files containing PII with the "LEAST development effort," as Macie provides this capability out-of-the-box.   
- [ ] Alerting with Amazon SNS: When Macie detects PII, it generates findings. These findings can be published to Amazon EventBridge, which can then trigger an Amazon SNS topic. Subscribing administrators to this SNS topic ensures they are alerted when PII is found.
- [ ] Path to Automated Remediation: While this option focuses on alerting administrators for removal, Macie's findings (via EventBridge) can also be used to trigger AWS Lambda functions for automated remediation actions (e.g., quarantining or deleting the object). This provides a pathway to the "automate remediation" requirement with further configuration, leveraging the initial PII discovery by Macie.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Amazon Inspector is a service that assesses Amazon EC2 instances for vulnerabilities and deviations from security best practices. It does not scan objects within S3 buckets for PII content.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Implementing custom scanning algorithms in an AWS Lambda function to detect PII would require significant development effort, including defining PII patterns, writing the scanning logic, and maintaining it. Amazon Macie offers this as a managed service, which aligns with the "LEAST development effort" requirement.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Similar to option C, this relies on custom scanning algorithms in Lambda, which means high development effort. While SES can send emails, SNS is typically more appropriate for system-generated alerts to administrators. The core issue is the custom development for PII scanning. (The typo "meats" likely means "objects").

  <summary>Question 47</summary>

A company needs guaranteed Amazon EC2 capacity in three specific Availability Zones in a specific AWS Region for an upcoming event that will last 1 week.

What should the company do to guarantee the EC2 capacity?

- [ ] A. Purchase Reserved Instances that specify the Region needed.
- [ ] B. Create an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region needed.
- [ ] C. Purchase Reserved Instances that specify the Region and three Availability Zones needed.
- [ ] D. Create an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region and three Availability Zones needed.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] D. Create an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region and three Availability Zones needed.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] On-Demand Capacity Reservations: This AWS service allows you to reserve compute capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone (AZ) for any duration. This ensures that you can launch the required number of instances of a specific type when you need them.
- [ ] Specificity for Availability Zones: The requirement is for guaranteed capacity in "three specific Availability Zones." On-Demand Capacity Reservations are created for a specific instance type within a specific AZ. The company would create separate capacity reservations for each of the three required AZs.
- [ ] Guaranteed Capacity for Short Duration: For an event lasting "1 week," On-Demand Capacity Reservations are ideal because they provide the capacity assurance without requiring a long-term commitment (unlike Reserved Instances). You can create them for the duration needed and then cancel them.
- [ ] Meets Requirements Directly: This option directly addresses the need for guaranteed capacity in specific AZs for a defined short-term period.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Regional Reserved Instances provide a billing discount and, for some types, can offer capacity benefits, but they do not guarantee capacity in specific Availability Zones. The capacity benefit of regional RIs is applied more broadly across AZs in a region. The requirement here is for guaranteed capacity in three specific AZs.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: While creating an On-Demand Capacity Reservation is the correct service, it must be specified for each particular Availability Zone where the capacity is needed. A capacity reservation that only "specifies the Region needed" without specifying the AZs would not guarantee capacity in the "three specific Availability Zones" required.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Purchasing Reserved Instances (RIs) involves a 1-year or 3-year commitment for a billing discount. While Zonal RIs (Reserved Instances purchased for a specific Availability Zone) do provide a capacity reservation, it is not the most flexible or cost-effective approach for guaranteeing capacity for only a 1-week event due to the long commitment term. On-Demand Capacity Reservations are better suited for short-term capacity assurance without the long-term financial commitment of RIs.

  <summary>Question 48</summary>

A company's website uses an Amazon EC2 instance store for its catalog of items. The company wants to make sure that the catalog is highly available and that the catalog is stored in a durable location.    

What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Move the catalog to Amazon ElastiCache for Redis. 
- [ ] B. Deploy a larger EC2 instance with a larger instance store. 
- [ ] C. Move the catalog from the instance store to Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive. 
- [ ] D. Move the catalog to an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system.    

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] D. Move the catalog to an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system.      

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Durability of Instance Stores: EC2 instance stores provide temporary, block-level storage. The data stored on an instance store volume is lost if the EC2 instance is stopped, hibernated, or terminated. This makes it unsuitable for storing a catalog that needs to be in a "durable location."    
- [ ] Amazon EFS for Durability and Availability: Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) offers scalable, elastic file storage that is designed for high availability and durability. Data in an EFS file system is stored redundantly across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within an AWS Region.
- [ ] This makes it both highly available (as it can withstand an AZ failure) and durable.   
- [ ] Shared Access: EFS file systems can be mounted and accessed by multiple EC2 instances concurrently, which can be beneficial if the website scales to use more than one instance.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Amazon ElastiCache for Redis is an in-memory caching service. While it can significantly improve the performance of accessing frequently requested data, it is not primarily designed as a durable, persistent storage solution for a catalog. Data in a cache can be lost if a cache node fails (though Redis can be configured with persistence, EFS is a more direct solution for durable file storage).    
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: Deploying a larger EC2 instance with a larger instance store does not change the fundamental characteristic that instance store volumes are ephemeral. The catalog data would still be at risk of loss if the instance fails or is terminated.    
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive is an extremely low-cost storage class intended for long-term data archiving and digital preservation, where data is rarely accessed, and retrieval times of several hours are acceptable. It is not suitable for hosting an active website catalog that requires frequent and low-latency access.

  <summary>Question 49</summary>

A company stores call transcript files on a monthly basis. Users access the files randomly within 1 year of the call, but users access the files infrequently after 1 year. The company wants to optimize its solution by giving users the ability to query and retrieve files that are less than 1-year-old as quickly as possible. A delay in retrieving older files is acceptable.

Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

- [ ] A. Store individual files with tags in Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval. Query the tags to retrieve the files from S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval.
- [ ] B. Store individual files in Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move the files to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 1 year. Query and retrieve the files that are in Amazon S3 by using Amazon Athena. Query and retrieve the files that are in S3 Glacier by using S3 Glacier Select.
- [ ] C. Store individual files with tags in Amazon S3 Standard storage. Store search metadata for each archive in Amazon S3 Standard storage. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move the files to S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval after 1 year. Query and retrieve the files by searching for metadata from Amazon S3.
- [ ] D. Store individual files in Amazon S3 Standard storage. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move the files to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year. Store search metadata in Amazon RDS. Query the files from Amazon RDS. Retrieve the files from S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

- [ ] B. Store individual files in Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move the files to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 1 year. Query and retrieve the files that are in Amazon S3 by using Amazon Athena. Query and retrieve the files that are in S3 Glacier by using S3 Glacier Select.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] S3 Intelligent-Tiering for Recent Files (< 1 year): For files accessed "randomly within 1 year," S3 Intelligent-Tiering is ideal. It automatically moves data between a frequent access tier (for quick retrieval) and an infrequent access tier to optimize costs based on actual access patterns, without performance impact or retrieval fees between these tiers. This ensures files less than 1 year old can be retrieved "as quickly as possible."
- [ ] Lifecycle to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval for Older Files (> 1 year): After 1 year, when files are "accessed infrequently" and "a delay in retrieving older files is acceptable," an S3 Lifecycle policy can transition these files to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval. This storage class is very cost-effective for archival data, with retrieval options ranging from minutes to hours, fitting the "delay is acceptable" criteria.
- [ ] Querying Capabilities:
- [ ] For files within S3 Intelligent-Tiering's active tiers (accessible via standard S3 APIs), Amazon Athena can be used for querying (e.g., if the transcripts or their metadata are in a queryable format).
- [ ] For files archived in S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, S3 Glacier Select allows you to perform SQL-like queries directly on the archived object's content without needing to restore the entire object, making it efficient to find and retrieve specific information from older files.
- [ ] MOST Cost-Effective Overall: This solution balances performance for newer files with aggressive cost savings for older, infrequently accessed files, along with appropriate query capabilities for both states.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Storing all files, including those actively and randomly accessed within the first year, directly in S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval would be more expensive for storage than using S3 Intelligent-Tiering for that initial period. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval is an archive tier, albeit with fast retrieval, but it's designed for data that is rarely accessed overall.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Using S3 Standard for the first year is less cost-optimal than S3 Intelligent-Tiering if access patterns are indeed random and include periods of infrequent access even within that first year. While S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval is a good option for archiving data that needs quick access, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (as in option B) generally offers lower storage costs if some retrieval delay (minutes to hours) is acceptable for files older than a year.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: S3 Glacier Deep Archive is the lowest-cost storage, but its retrieval times are typically 12 hours or more. While a delay is acceptable, this might be longer than necessary or practical. More significantly, storing search metadata in Amazon RDS introduces the cost and operational overhead of managing a relational database. A combination of S3 object metadata, Athena, and S3 Glacier Select often provides a more cost-effective and integrated querying solution for data stored in S3 and its archive tiers.

  <summary>Question 50</summary>

A company has a production workload that runs on 1,000 Amazon EC2 Linux instances. The workload is powered by third-party software. The company needs to patch the third-party software on all EC2 instances as quickly as possible to remediate a critical security vulnerability.    

What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Create an AWS Lambda function to apply the patch to all EC2 instances. 
- [ ] B. Configure AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to apply the patch to all EC2 instances. 
- [ ] C. Schedule an AWS Systems Manager maintenance window to apply the patch to all EC2 instances. 
- [ ] D. Use AWS Systems Manager Run Command to run a custom command that applies the patch to all EC2 instances.    

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] D. Use AWS Systems Manager Run Command to run a custom command that applies the patch to all EC2 instances.    

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] AWS Systems Manager Run Command for Immediate Execution: AWS Systems Manager Run Command allows you to remotely and securely execute commands on a fleet of managed instances (including EC2 instances) at scale. For a "critical security vulnerability" that needs to be remediated "as quickly as possible," Run Command provides the ability to immediately execute the necessary custom scripts or commands to apply the patch for the "third-party software."    
- [ ] Scalability and Targeting: Run Command can target a large number of instances (like 1,000) simultaneously based on tags, resource groups, or individual instance IDs. This ensures the patch is applied broadly and quickly.
- [ ] Custom Commands for Third-Party Software: Since it's a patch for third-party software, it will likely require specific commands or a custom script for installation, which Run Command can execute.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] A. Create an AWS Lambda function to apply the patch to all EC2 instances.    
While Lambda can automate tasks, using it to orchestrate patching across 1,000 EC2 instances (which might involve establishing connections, executing commands remotely, handling state, and managing errors for each instance) would be a complex custom solution to build and manage, especially for urgent deployment. AWS Systems Manager provides purpose-built tools for this.
- [ ] B. Configure AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to apply the patch to all EC2 instances.    
AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager is designed to automate the patching of operating systems and some common applications based on defined patch baselines and schedules. While it can be extended for some application patching, it is generally more structured and might not be the quickest method for deploying an urgent, custom patch for specific "third-party software" that isn't covered by standard patch baselines. Run Command offers more direct control for immediate, custom actions.
- [ ] C. Schedule an AWS Systems Manager maintenance window to apply the patch to all EC2 instances.    
Maintenance windows are used to define recurring schedules for performing potentially disruptive actions like patching to minimize impact on production workloads. The requirement here is to remediate a "critical security vulnerability" "as quickly as possible." Waiting for a scheduled maintenance window or setting one up might introduce unacceptable delays. Run Command allows for immediate execution.
