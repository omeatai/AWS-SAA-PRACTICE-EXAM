A company is developing an application that provides order shipping statistics for retrieval by a REST API. The company wants to extract the shipping statistics, organize the data into an easy-to-read HTML format, and send the report to several email addresses at the same time every morning.

Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

- [ ] A. Configure the application to send the data to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.
- [ ] B. Use Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to format the data and to send the report by email.
- [ ] C. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) scheduled event that invokes an AWS Glue job to query the application's API for the data.
- [ ] D. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) scheduled event that invokes an AWS Lambda function to query the application's API for the data.
- [ ] E. Store the application data in Amazon S3. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic as an S3 event destination to send the report by email.

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] B. Use Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to format the data and to send the report by email.
- [ ] D. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) scheduled event that invokes an AWS Lambda function to query the application's API for the data.

Why these are the correct answers:

- [ ] D. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) scheduled event that invokes an AWS Lambda function to query the application's API for the data.
Scheduled Execution: To send the report "at the same time every morning," a scheduled trigger is needed. Amazon EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events) allows you to create scheduled rules (e.g., using a cron expression) that can trigger various AWS services.
Data Extraction and Formatting: An AWS Lambda function is well-suited to be invoked by the EventBridge schedule. The Lambda function can then make a request to the application's REST API to "extract the shipping statistics." Once the data is retrieved, the Lambda function can "organize the data into an easy-to-read HTML format." Lambda is a serverless compute service ideal for such event-driven tasks.
- [ ] B. Use Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to format the data and to send the report by email.
Email Delivery: Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) is a cloud-based email sending service designed to send notification and transactional emails. It can be used by the Lambda function (from option D) to "send the report to several email addresses."
Sending HTML Emails: While the Lambda function would primarily handle the HTML formatting of the report content, SES is capable of sending emails with HTML content, allowing the "easy-to-read HTML format" to be delivered effectively.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is designed for capturing, transforming, and loading streaming data into data lakes, data stores, and analytics services. It is not suitable for querying a REST API on a schedule to extract statistics for a daily email report.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: While Amazon EventBridge is appropriate for scheduling, using an AWS Glue job for this task is overly complex and not its primary design purpose. AWS Glue is an ETL (extract, transform, and load) service more suited for large-scale data processing and cataloging, typically involving data stores like S3 or databases, rather than querying a REST API for a daily report and formatting HTML for email. An AWS Lambda function is more lightweight and fitting for this scenario.
- [ ] Option E is wrong because: This option suggests storing data in S3 and using S3 event notifications with Amazon SNS. The primary data source is a REST API, not new objects being written to S3 that would trigger an event. While SNS can send email notifications, it is generally more for simple notifications, and SES (as in option B) provides more robust capabilities for sending formatted HTML emails, managing sender reputation, and handling bounces or complaints, which is more suitable for sending reports.

  <summary>Question 52</summary>

A company wants to migrate its on-premises application to AWS. The application produces output files that vary in size from tens of gigabytes to hundreds of terabytes. The application data must be stored in a standard file system structure. The company wants a solution that scales automatically, is highly available, and requires minimum operational overhead.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Migrate the application to run as containers on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Use Amazon S3 for storage.
- [ ] B. Migrate the application to run as containers on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). Use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) for storage.
- [ ] C. Migrate the application to Amazon EC2 instances in a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) for storage.
- [ ] D. Migrate the application to Amazon EC2 instances in a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) for storage.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] C. Migrate the application to Amazon EC2 instances in a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) for storage.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Standard File System Structure (Amazon EFS): The requirement that "application data must be stored in a standard file system structure" points towards a service like Amazon EFS. EFS provides elastic, scalable file storage that uses the Network File System (NFS) protocol, which is a standard file system interface. EC2 instances can mount an EFS file system just like any network file share.
- [ ] Scales Automatically (EFS and Auto Scaling): EFS storage capacity scales automatically up or down as you add or remove files, so you don't need to provision storage in advance. Running the application on EC2 instances within a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group allows the compute tier to scale automatically based on demand.
- [ ] Highly Available (EFS and Multi-AZ Auto Scaling): EFS is designed for high availability and durability by storing data redundantly across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within a region. A Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group ensures that the application instances are also distributed across multiple AZs for high availability.
- [ ] Minimum Operational Overhead: EFS is a fully managed service, removing the need to manage file servers or storage infrastructure. EC2 Auto Scaling also reduces the operational burden of managing the compute fleet.
- [ ] Handles Large Files/Datasets: EFS can store petabytes of data and supports large individual file sizes, suitable for "output files that vary in size from tens of gigabytes to hundreds of terabytes" (this likely refers to total dataset size, as individual files in EFS have a limit, but the system as a whole can scale).

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: While ECS is a good option for running containerized applications, Amazon S3 is an object storage service. It does not provide a standard, mountable file system structure that an application expecting POSIX-like file system semantics can directly use without modification or tools like S3FS (which can have performance implications). The requirement is for a "standard file system structure."
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides block-level storage volumes for EC2 instances. A standard EBS volume can only be attached to a single EC2 instance at a time within a specific AZ. While EKS can manage containers, if these containers need shared access to a "standard file system structure" across multiple nodes (especially across AZs for high availability), EBS is not the direct solution. EFS or FSx would be better for shared file storage.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Similar to option B, using EBS with EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group means each instance would typically have its own isolated EBS volume(s). This does not provide a shared "standard file system structure" that can be concurrently accessed by all instances in the Auto Scaling group, which is often implied when an application needs a common file system.

  <summary>Question 53</summary>

A company needs to store its accounting records in Amazon S3. The records must be immediately accessible for 1 year and then must be archived for an additional 9 years. No one at the company, including administrative users and root users, can be able to delete the records during the entire 10-year period. The records must be stored with maximum resiliency.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Store the records in S3 Glacier for the entire 10-year period. Use an access control policy to deny deletion of the records for a period of 10 years.
- [ ] B. Store the records by using S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Use an IAM policy to deny deletion of the records. After 10 years, change the IAM policy to allow deletion.
- [ ] C. Use an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the records from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year. Use S3 Object Lock in compliance mode for a period of 10 years.
- [ ] D. Use an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the records from S3 Standard to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 1 year. Use S3 Object Lock in governance mode for a period of 10 years.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] C. Use an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the records from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year. Use S3 Object Lock in compliance mode for a period of 10 years.

Why this is the correct answer:

Immediate Accessibility and Archival:
- [ ] Storing records initially in Amazon S3 Standard (implied, as lifecycle policies transition from a storage class) ensures they are "immediately accessible for 1 year."    
- [ ] An S3 Lifecycle policy can then "transition the records from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year." S3 Glacier Deep Archive is designed for long-term, low-cost archival storage, fitting the "archived for an additional 9 years" requirement.    
- [ ] Non-Deletion by Anyone (S3 Object Lock in Compliance Mode):
- [ ] S3 Object Lock in compliance mode is a Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) model. When an object version is locked in compliance mode, its retention mode cannot be changed, and its retention period cannot be shortened by any user, including the root user in the AWS account, for the duration of the specified retention period (10 years in this case).  This stringently meets the requirement that "No one at the company, including administrative users and root users, can be able to delete the records during the entire 10-year period."    
- [ ] Maximum Resiliency:
- [ ] Amazon S3 Standard and S3 Glacier Deep Archive both store data redundantly across multiple (at least three) Availability Zones within an AWS Region, providing "maximum resiliency."    

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Storing records directly in S3 Glacier (e.g., S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive) from the beginning does not allow for immediate accessibility during the first year, as standard retrievals from these services take minutes to hours.  While an access control policy can deny deletions, it can typically be modified or bypassed by users with sufficient privileges (like root or administrators), unlike S3 Object Lock in compliance mode.    
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: An IAM policy denying deletion can be altered or overridden by users with the necessary administrative permissions, including the root user. This does not provide the same level of immutability as S3 Object Lock in compliance mode, which is needed to ensure "No one... can be able to delete the records."  S3 Intelligent-Tiering is for optimizing costs based on access patterns but doesn't inherently provide the stringent deletion protection required.   
- [ ] Option D is wrong because:
S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) stores data in a single Availability Zone.  This does not offer "maximum resiliency" as data would be lost if that single AZ experiences a failure.    
S3 Object Lock in governance mode allows users with specific IAM permissions (s3:BypassGovernanceRetention) to override the lock settings or delete objects. This does not meet the requirement that "No one... can be able to delete the records."  Compliance mode is stricter.

  <summary>Question 54</summary>

A company runs multiple Windows workloads on AWS. The company's employees use Windows file shares that are hosted on two Amazon EC2 instances. The file shares synchronize data between themselves and maintain duplicate copies. The company wants a highly available and durable storage solution that preserves how users currently access the files.

What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Migrate all the data to Amazon S3. Set up IAM authentication for users to access files.
- [ ] B. Set up an Amazon S3 File Gateway. Mount the S3 File Gateway on the existing EC2 instances.
- [ ] C. Extend the file share environment to Amazon FSx for Windows File Server with a Multi-AZ configuration. Migrate all the data to FSx for Windows File Server.
- [ ] D. Extend the file share environment to Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) with a Multi-AZ configuration. Migrate all the data to Amazon EFS.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] A.  Turn
Correct Answer: C

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Amazon FSx for Windows File Server: This service provides fully managed, native Microsoft Windows file systems, which means it supports the SMB (Server Message Block) protocol used by Windows file shares. This directly addresses the requirement to "preserve how users currently access the files".   
- [ ] High Availability and Durability: Amazon FSx for Windows File Server supports Multi-AZ deployments. In a Multi-AZ configuration, FSx automatically provisions and maintains a standby file server in a different Availability Zone, and data is synchronously replicated. This ensures high availability and enhances durability, protecting against the loss of an AZ.   
- [ ] Replaces EC2-based File Shares: Migrating the data to FSx for Windows File Server replaces the existing solution of two EC2 instances manually synchronizing data, which can be complex and less reliable. FSx is a managed service designed for this purpose, reducing operational overhead.
- [ ] Preserves Access Patterns: Users can continue to access the file shares using their existing Windows credentials (as FSx integrates with Active Directory) and familiar drive mapping methods.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Amazon S3 is an object storage service. While it's highly durable and scalable, it does not natively provide SMB file share access. Users would need to change how they access files (e.g., via S3 APIs, console, or third-party tools), which does not "preserve how users currently access the files".   
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: While an Amazon S3 File Gateway can provide an SMB interface to data stored in S3, mounting this gateway on the existing EC2 instances that currently host the shares doesn't fully replace the EC2-based solution with a more robust, managed file server. The goal is to improve the availability and durability of the storage solution itself, and FSx for Windows File Server directly provides a managed Windows file system.   
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) is a file storage service that uses the NFS (Network File System) protocol. While EFS is highly available and scalable, Windows environments typically use the SMB protocol for file sharing. Using EFS would require Windows clients to use an NFS client or other workarounds, which does not "preserve how users currently access the files"  in a native Windows file share manner.

  <summary>Question 55</summary>

A solutions architect is developing a VPC architecture that includes multiple subnets. The architecture will host applications that use Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon RDS DB instances. The architecture consists of six subnets in two Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone includes a public subnet, a private subnet, and a dedicated subnet for databases. Only EC2 instances that run in the private subnets can have access to the RDS databases.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Create a new route table that excludes the route to the public subnets' CIDR blocks. Associate the route table with the database subnets.
- [ ] B. Create a security group that denies inbound traffic from the security group that is assigned to instances in the public subnets. Attach the security group to the DB instances.
- [ ] C. Create a security group that allows inbound traffic from the security group that is assigned to instances in the private subnets. Attach the security group to the DB instances.
- [ ] D. Create a new peering connection between the public subnets and the private subnets. Create a different peering connection between the private subnets and the database subnets.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] C. Create a security group that allows inbound traffic from the security group that is assigned to instances in the private subnets. Attach the security group to the DB instances.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Security Groups for Instance-Level Access Control: Security groups act as stateful virtual firewalls for your instances (including EC2 and RDS) to control inbound and outbound traffic. They operate at the instance level.
- [ ] Referencing Security Groups as a Source: A key feature of security groups is that you can specify another security group as the source for an inbound rule. This allows instances associated with the source security group to access instances associated with the destination security group on the specified ports and protocols.
- [ ] Meeting the Requirement:
- [ ] You would have a security group (e.g., sg-private-app) attached to the EC2 instances running in the private subnets.
- [ ] You would have a security group (e.g., sg-database) attached to the RDS DB instances in the database subnets.
- [ ] In the inbound rules of sg-database, you would add a rule that allows traffic on the database port (e.g., 3306 for MySQL, 5432 for PostgreSQL) and specifies sg-private-app as the source. This configuration ensures that only EC2 instances in the private subnets (those associated with sg-private-app) can initiate connections to the RDS databases. All other traffic would be implicitly denied by the security group.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Route tables control the routing of traffic at the subnet level (i.e., where network packets are sent). While they are essential for connectivity between subnets, they do not provide the fine-grained, stateful, instance-level access control that security groups offer. Modifying route tables for the database subnets wouldn't specifically grant or deny access from instances in private subnets based on instance identity or group membership.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: Security groups work on an "allow list" principle. By default, all inbound traffic is denied unless explicitly allowed by an inbound rule. There is no explicit "deny" rule in security groups. To achieve the desired outcome, you should allow traffic from the intended source (private subnets' instances) rather than trying to explicitly deny traffic from other sources like public subnets.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: VPC peering connections are used to enable private network connectivity between two different VPCs. The scenario describes subnets (public, private, database) that are all part of the same VPC architecture. Therefore, VPC peering is not relevant or necessary for controlling access between these subnets. Access control within a single VPC is managed using security groups and Network Access Control Lists (NACLs).

A company has registered its domain name with Amazon Route 53. The company uses Amazon API Gateway in the ca-central-1 Region as a public interface for its backend microservice APIs. Third-party services consume the APIs securely. The company wants to design its API Gateway URL with the company's domain name and corresponding certificate so that the third-party services can use HTTPS.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Create stage variables in API Gateway with Name="Endpoint-URL" and Value="Company Domain Name" to overwrite the default URL. Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
- [ ] B. Create Route 53 DNS records with the company's domain name. Point the alias record to the Regional API Gateway stage endpoint. Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the us-east-1 Region.
- [ ] C. Create a Regional API Gateway endpoint. Associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name. Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the same Region. Attach the certificate to the API Gateway endpoint. Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the API Gateway endpoint.
- [ ] D. Create a Regional API Gateway endpoint. Associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name. Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the us-east-1 Region. Attach the certificate to the API Gateway APIs. Create Route 53 DNS records with the company's domain name. Point an A record to the company's domain name.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] C. Create a Regional API Gateway endpoint. Associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name. Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the same Region. Attach the certificate to the API Gateway endpoint. Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the API Gateway endpoint.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Custom Domain Name for API Gateway: Amazon API Gateway allows you to set up a custom domain name (e.g., api.yourcompany.com) for your APIs. This involves creating a custom domain name resource within API Gateway.
- [ ] Regional Endpoint and Certificate Location: The question states the API Gateway is in the ca-central-1 Region, implying a Regional API endpoint. For Regional API Gateway custom domain names, the SSL/TLS certificate must be imported into or provisioned by AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the same AWS Region as the API Gateway (i.e., ca-central-1).
- [ ] Certificate Association: The imported public certificate from ACM is then associated with the custom domain name configuration in API Gateway.
- [ ] Route 53 Configuration: Finally, you create a DNS record (typically an Alias record for AWS resources) in Amazon Route 53 to point your custom domain name (e.g., api.yourcompany.com) to the API Gateway regional custom domain name target that API Gateway provides after you configure the custom domain.
- [ ] This sequence correctly sets up a custom domain with HTTPS for a Regional API Gateway endpoint.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Stage variables in API Gateway are used for passing configuration settings to your API stages (like different backend endpoints for dev vs. prod). They cannot be used to overwrite the default API Gateway URL with a custom domain name.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: For a Regional API Gateway custom domain, the ACM certificate must be in the same Region as the API Gateway instance (ca-central-1 in this case). ACM certificates in us-east-1 are required for Edge-Optimized API Gateway endpoints (which use Amazon CloudFront) or for CloudFront distributions themselves, not for regional custom domains.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: This option also incorrectly states that the ACM certificate for a Regional API Gateway custom domain should be in us-east-1. Additionally, creating an A record pointing the "company's domain name" to itself is a circular reference and incorrect. The DNS record needs to point the custom domain to the API Gateway's specific target domain name provided for custom domains.

A company is running a popular social media website. The website gives users the ability to upload images to share with other users. The company wants to make sure that the images do not contain inappropriate content. The company needs a solution that minimizes development effort.

What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Use Amazon Comprehend to detect inappropriate content. Use human review for low-confidence predictions.
- [ ] B. Use Amazon Rekognition to detect inappropriate content. Use human review for low-confidence predictions.
- [ ] C. Use Amazon SageMaker to detect inappropriate content. Use ground truth to label low-confidence predictions.
- [ ] D. Use AWS Fargate to deploy a custom machine learning model to detect inappropriate content. Use ground truth to label low-confidence predictions.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] B. Use Amazon Rekognition to detect inappropriate content. Use human review for low-confidence predictions.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Amazon Rekognition for Image Moderation: Amazon Rekognition is an AWS service that provides pre-trained machine learning models for image and video analysis. It includes specific content moderation capabilities to detect inappropriate, unwanted, or offensive content (e.g., nudity, violence, suggestive content) in images and videos. This directly addresses the requirement to ensure images do not contain inappropriate content.
- [ ] Minimizes Development Effort: As a managed service with pre-trained models, Amazon Rekognition requires significantly less development effort compared to building, training, and deploying a custom machine learning model using services like Amazon SageMaker or a custom deployment on Fargate. You can integrate Rekognition into your application using its API.
- [ ] Human Review for Low-Confidence Predictions: Rekognition provides confidence scores for its moderation labels. For cases where the confidence score is low, it's a common best practice to implement a human review workflow (e.g., using Amazon Augmented AI - A2I, or a custom system) to ensure accuracy and handle ambiguous content appropriately.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Amazon Comprehend is a natural language processing (NLP) service designed to extract insights from text. It is not suitable for analyzing image content to detect inappropriate visuals.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Amazon SageMaker is a comprehensive machine learning platform for building, training, and deploying custom ML models. While you could theoretically build a custom image moderation model with SageMaker, this would involve substantial development effort (data collection, labeling, model training, and deployment), which contradicts the requirement to "minimize development effort." Rekognition offers this functionality out-of-the-box.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Developing a custom machine learning model and deploying it on AWS Fargate would also require significant development effort to create and train the model, similar to using SageMaker. This approach does not leverage pre-built AWS AI services for common tasks like content moderation and therefore does not minimize development effort.

A company wants to run its critical applications in containers to meet requirements for scalability and availability. The company prefers to focus on maintenance of the critical applications. The company does not want to be responsible for provisioning and managing the underlying infrastructure that runs the containerized workload.

What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Use Amazon EC2 instances, and install Docker on the instances.
- [ ] B. Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) on Amazon EC2 worker nodes.
- [ ] C. Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) on AWS Fargate.
- [ ] D. Use Amazon EC2 instances from an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)-optimized Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] C. Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) on AWS Fargate.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) for Container Orchestration: ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service that simplifies deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications. This helps meet the requirements for running applications in containers for scalability and availability.    
- [ ] AWS Fargate for Serverless Compute: AWS Fargate is a serverless, pay-as-you-go compute engine for containers that works with both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS. When using Fargate with ECS, you do not need to provision, configure, scale, or manage the underlying virtual machines (EC2 instances). AWS handles all the infrastructure management. This directly addresses the company's desire to "not want to be responsible for provisioning and managing the underlying infrastructure" and allows them to "focus on maintenance of the critical applications."    
- [ ] Scalability and Availability: ECS with Fargate allows you to define your application, specify CPU and memory requirements, define networking and IAM policies, and launch. It handles scaling and availability aspects without requiring server management.    

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Using Amazon EC2 instances and installing Docker manually means the company would be fully responsible for provisioning, managing, patching, and scaling the EC2 instances, as well as managing the Docker environment and potentially the container orchestration. This directly contradicts the requirement of not wanting to manage the underlying infrastructure.    
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: Using Amazon ECS with the EC2 launch type (on Amazon EC2 worker nodes) still requires the company to provision, manage, and scale the cluster of EC2 instances that run the containers. While ECS manages the containers, the underlying server infrastructure management remains the company's responsibility.    
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Using EC2 instances from an ECS-optimized AMI simplifies the setup of EC2 instances for an ECS cluster (EC2 launch type), but it still means the company is responsible for managing those EC2 instances (patching, scaling, security). This does not remove the responsibility for the underlying infrastructure.

A company hosts more than 300 global websites and applications. The company requires a platform to analyze more than 30 TB of clickstream data each day.

What should a solutions architect do to transmit and process the clickstream data?

- [ ] A. Design an AWS Data Pipeline to archive the data to an Amazon S3 bucket and run an Amazon EMR cluster with the data to generate analytics.
- [ ] B. Create an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances to process the data and send it to an Amazon S3 data lake for Amazon Redshift to use for analysis.
- [ ] C. Cache the data to Amazon CloudFront. Store the data in an Amazon S3 bucket. When an object is added to the S3 bucket. run an AWS Lambda function to process the data for analysis.
- [ ] D. Collect the data from Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to transmit the data to an Amazon S3 data lake. Load the data in Amazon Redshift for analysis.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] D. Collect the data from Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to transmit the data to an Amazon S3 data lake. Load the data in Amazon Redshift for analysis.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for Real-Time Ingestion: For collecting high-volume (30 TB/day) clickstream data from hundreds of global sources in real-time, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a suitable and scalable ingestion service. It can handle a continuous flow of data.
- [ ] Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose for Delivery to S3 Data Lake: Kinesis Data Firehose can take data from Kinesis Data Streams (or directly from data producers) and reliably load it into destinations like Amazon S3. It can also batch, compress, and encrypt the data before delivery, which is efficient for building an S3 data lake with large volumes of clickstream data.
- [ ] Amazon Redshift for Analysis: Amazon Redshift is a petabyte-scale data warehouse service optimized for complex analytical queries on large datasets. Loading data from an S3 data lake into Redshift is a common and effective pattern for analyzing clickstream data to derive insights.
- [ ] Scalable and Managed Pipeline: This combination of services provides a robust, scalable, and largely managed pipeline for ingesting, storing, and analyzing large volumes of clickstream data with less operational overhead than building custom solutions.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: AWS Data Pipeline is a service for orchestrating scheduled, batch data movement and transformation workflows. While it can involve S3 and EMR, Kinesis services are generally better suited for ingesting and preparing continuous, high-volume real-time data like clickstream data.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: Building a custom solution with an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances to process 30 TB of clickstream data daily would involve significant development and operational overhead for managing the instances, the data processing logic, and ensuring scalability and fault tolerance. Managed services like Kinesis offer these capabilities with less effort.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) used for caching and delivering web content to users with low latency; it's not a primary tool for collecting clickstream data for backend analysis. While AWS Lambda can process data from S3, processing 30 TB of data daily using Lambda triggered by S3 object creation might be inefficient for this scale compared to stream processing or batch analytics services like EMR or Redshift for the analysis part. The ingestion via Kinesis is also missing.

A company has a website hosted on AWS. The website is behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) that is configured to handle HTTP and HTTPS separately. The company wants to forward all requests to the website so that the requests will use HTTPS.

What should a solutions architect do to meet this requirement?

- [ ] A. Update the ALB's network ACL to accept only HTTPS traffic.
- [ ] B. Create a rule that replaces the HTTP in the URL with HTTPS.
- [ ] C. Create a listener rule on the ALB to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
- [ ] D. Replace the ALB with a Network Load Balancer configured to use Server Name Indication (SNI).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] C. Create a listener rule on the ALB to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Application Load Balancer (ALB) Listener Rules: ALBs allow you to define listeners for different ports and protocols (e.g., HTTP on port 80 and HTTPS on port 443). For each listener, you can configure rules that determine how requests are routed.
- [ ] HTTP to HTTPS Redirection: A common and recommended practice is to configure the HTTP listener (on port 80) with a rule that performs a redirect action.
- [ ] This rule will automatically redirect all incoming HTTP requests to the corresponding HTTPS URL (on port 443).
- [ ] This ensures that users who try to access the site via HTTP are seamlessly forwarded to the secure HTTPS version. This is a built-in feature of ALBs designed for this exact purpose.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Network ACLs (NACLs) operate at the subnet level and are stateless firewalls. While you could use a NACL to block HTTP traffic, it would not "forward" or "redirect" requests to HTTPS; it would simply drop or deny the HTTP requests. The goal is to ensure users end up on HTTPS, not just block HTTP. Furthermore, ALB nodes are managed by AWS, and manipulating their direct NACLs is not the standard way to control ALB behavior.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: This statement is too vague. While the outcome is to have the URL use HTTPS, it doesn't specify how or where this rule would be implemented. Option C provides the specific, AWS-native mechanism (ALB listener rule) to achieve this at the load balancer level, which is the appropriate place for this kind of infrastructure-level redirection.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because:
Network Load Balancers (NLBs) operate at Layer 4 (transport layer) and are not as feature-rich for HTTP/HTTPS traffic management as ALBs, which operate at Layer 7 (application layer). ALBs are better suited for tasks like HTTP to HTTPS redirection.
Server Name Indication (SNI) is a TLS extension that allows a server to present multiple certificates on the same IP address and port, enabling hosting of multiple SSL-secured websites on one server. While NLBs do support SNI (for TLS listeners), SNI itself is not a mechanism for redirecting HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

  <summary>Question 61</summary>

A company is developing a two-tier web application on AWS. The company's developers have deployed the application on an Amazon EC2 instance that connects directly to a backend Amazon RDS database. The company must not hardcode database credentials in the application. The company must also implement a solution to automatically rotate the database credentials on a regular basis.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- [ ] A. Store the database credentials in the instance metadata. Use Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rules to run a scheduled AWS Lambda function that updates the RDS credentials and instance metadata at the same time.
- [ ] B. Store the database credentials in a configuration file in an encrypted Amazon S3 bucket. Use Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rules to run a scheduled AWS Lambda function that updates the RDS credentials and the credentials in the configuration file at the same time. Use S3 Versioning to ensure the ability to fall back to previous values.
- [ ] C. Store the database credentials as a secret in AWS Secrets Manager. Turn on automatic rotation for the secret. Attach the required permission to the EC2 role to grant access to the secret.
- [ ] D. Store the database credentials as encrypted parameters in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Turn on automatic rotation for the encrypted parameters. Attach the required permission to the EC2 role to grant access to the encrypted parameters.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] C. Store the database credentials as a secret in AWS Secrets Manager. Turn on automatic rotation for the secret. Attach the required permission to the EC2 role to grant access to the secret.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] AWS Secrets Manager for Secure Credential Management: AWS Secrets Manager is specifically designed to help you protect access to your applications, services, and IT resources without the upfront investment and ongoing maintenance costs of operating your own infrastructure. It allows you to store database credentials securely. This meets the requirement to not hardcode credentials.   
- [ ] Automatic Rotation: A key feature of Secrets Manager is its ability to automatically rotate secrets for supported services like Amazon RDS on a schedule you define. This directly addresses the requirement for automatic credential rotation with minimal operational overhead, as AWS manages the rotation process.
- [ ] Secure Access via IAM Roles: The application running on the EC2 instance can be granted permissions to retrieve the database credentials from Secrets Manager by attaching an appropriate IAM role to the EC2 instance. The application code would then fetch the credentials from Secrets Manager at runtime.
- [ ] Least Operational Overhead: This solution relies on a fully managed AWS service for both storing and automatically rotating credentials, which is the most straightforward approach with the least ongoing management effort.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Storing sensitive database credentials directly in EC2 instance metadata is not a secure practice, as instance metadata is accessible from within the instance. Building a custom rotation solution with EventBridge and Lambda adds operational overhead compared to the managed rotation offered by Secrets Manager.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: While storing credentials in an encrypted S3 bucket is more secure than hardcoding, it still requires custom logic for the application to retrieve and decrypt the credentials. The rotation process via EventBridge and Lambda is also a custom solution, which means more development and maintenance effort (higher operational overhead) compared to using Secrets Manager's built-in rotation capabilities.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store can store secrets securely (as SecureString parameters) and integrate with IAM for access control. However, while Parameter Store can be integrated with AWS Lambda to build custom rotation logic, its native, out-of-the-box automatic rotation capabilities for RDS database credentials are not as direct or comprehensive as those provided by AWS Secrets Manager. Secrets Manager is the preferred service for fully managed, automatic rotation of RDS credentials, resulting in less operational overhead for this specific task.

  <summary>Question 62</summary>
  
A company is deploying a new public web application to AWS. The application will run behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The application needs to be encrypted at the edge with an SSL/TLS certificate that is issued by an external certificate authority (CA). The certificate must be rotated each year before the certificate expires.

What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue an SSL/TLS certificate. Apply the certificate to the ALB. Use the managed renewal feature to automatically rotate the certificate.
- [ ] B. Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue an SSL/TLS certificate. Import the key material from the certificate. Apply the certificate to the ALB. Use the managed renewal feature to automatically rotate the certificate.
- [ ] C. Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) Private Certificate Authority to issue an SSL/TLS certificate from the root CA. Apply the certificate to the ALB. Use the managed renewal feature to automatically rotate the certificate.
- [ ] D. Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to import an SSL/TLS certificate. Apply the certificate to the ALB. Use Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) to send a notification when the certificate is nearing expiration. Rotate the certificate manually.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] D. Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to import an SSL/TLS certificate. Apply the certificate to the ALB. Use Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) to send a notification when the certificate is nearing expiration. Rotate the certificate manually.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Using an Externally Issued Certificate: The requirement states that the SSL/TLS certificate is "issued by an external certificate authority (CA)."
- [ ] Importing into ACM: AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) allows you to import third-party SSL/TLS certificates that you've obtained from an external CA. Once imported, these certificates can be used with integrated AWS services like Application Load Balancers (ALBs).
- [ ] Applying to ALB: After the certificate is imported into ACM, it can be associated with the ALB's HTTPS listener to enable SSL/TLS termination at the load balancer.
- [ ] Manual Rotation for Imported Certificates: ACM's automatic managed renewal feature only applies to public certificates that are issued by ACM. For certificates that are imported into ACM from an external CA, ACM does not manage their renewal. The company is responsible for renewing the certificate with the external CA and then re-importing the new certificate into ACM before the existing one expires.
- [ ] Notification for Expiration: To manage this manual rotation process, it's a best practice to set up notifications. Amazon EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events) can be used with ACM to detect when an imported certificate is nearing its expiration date. An EventBridge rule can then trigger a notification (e.g., via Amazon SNS to email administrators) to remind them to rotate the certificate manually.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: This suggests using ACM to issue an SSL/TLS certificate. However, the requirement is to use a certificate "issued by an external certificate authority." While ACM can issue public certificates (which do support managed renewal), this option doesn't align with the given constraint about the certificate's origin.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: This option is contradictory. It first says "Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue an SSL/TLS certificate" and then "Import the key material from the certificate." If ACM issues the certificate, you don't separately import its key material in that manner. Furthermore, it still relies on managed renewal, which isn't available for externally issued certificates.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) Private Certificate Authority (PCA) is used to create and manage private SSL/TLS certificates for internal use cases (e.g., within your organization's private network, for encrypting traffic between internal services). For a "public web application" that needs to be trusted by users' browsers, a publicly trusted certificate is required, not one issued by a private CA (unless the private CA's root is distributed to all clients, which is not typical for public applications).

  <summary>Question 63</summary>
 
A company runs its infrastructure on AWS and has a registered base of 700,000 users for its document management application. The company intends to create a product that converts large .pdf files to .jpg image files. The .pdf files average 5 MB in size. The company needs to store the original files and the converted files.

A solutions architect must design a scalable solution to accommodate demand that will grow rapidly over time.

Which solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

- [ ] A. Save the .pdf files to Amazon S3. Configure an S3 PUT event to invoke an AWS Lambda function to convert the files to .jpg format and store them back in Amazon S3.
- [ ] B. Save the .pdf files to Amazon DynamoDB. Use the DynamoDB Streams feature to invoke an AWS Lambda function to convert the files to .jpg format and store them back in DynamoDB.
- [ ] C. Upload the .pdf files to an AWS Elastic Beanstalk application that includes Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) storage, and an Auto Scaling group. Use a program in the EC2 instances to convert the files to .jpg format. Save the .pdf files and the .jpg files in the EBS store.
- [ ] D. Upload the .pdf files to an AWS Elastic Beanstalk application that includes Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) storage, and an Auto Scaling group. Use a program in the EC2 instances to convert the file to .jpg format. Save the .pdf files and the .jpg files in the EBS store.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] A. Save the .pdf files to Amazon S3. Configure an S3 PUT event to invoke an AWS Lambda function to convert the files to .jpg format and store them back in Amazon S3.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Amazon S3 for Scalable and Cost-Effective Storage: Amazon S3 is the ideal service for storing both the original .pdf files and the converted .jpg files. S3 offers virtually unlimited scalability, high durability, and is very cost-effective for storing files of any size.
- [ ] S3 Event Triggers for Automation: When a new .pdf file is uploaded to S3 (a PUT event), S3 can be configured to automatically trigger an AWS Lambda function. This provides an event-driven architecture.
- [ ] AWS Lambda for Serverless Conversion: AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that can execute code in response to events. A Lambda function can be written to take the S3 object key of the uploaded .pdf, perform the conversion to .jpg format (using appropriate libraries), and then store the resulting .jpg file back into an S3 bucket (possibly a different bucket or prefix).
- [ ] Scalability and Cost-Effectiveness: This serverless approach is highly scalable. Lambda automatically scales based on the number of incoming S3 events (uploads). You only pay for the S3 storage used and the Lambda compute time consumed during the conversion. This is generally the MOST cost-effective solution for event-driven file processing, especially when demand can grow rapidly, as you don't pay for idle compute resources. It also has minimal operational overhead.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option B is wrong because: Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL key-value and document database. While it can store small binary objects (up to 400 KB per item), it is not designed or cost-effective for storing 5 MB .pdf files directly. S3 is the appropriate service for this type of file storage.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Using AWS Elastic Beanstalk with Amazon EC2 instances to perform the conversion introduces the overhead of managing servers, even with Elastic Beanstalk's automation. This solution is less cost-effective than Lambda because you pay for EC2 instances even when no files are being processed. Storing files on Amazon EBS volumes is also less scalable and durable for this use case compared to S3, especially if you need to share or access these files from multiple places or ensure their long-term persistence independently of EC2 instances.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Similar to option C, this relies on EC2 instances managed by Elastic Beanstalk, which is less cost-effective and has higher operational overhead than a serverless Lambda approach for this task. While Amazon EFS provides shared file storage, S3 is generally more cost-effective and scalable for storing large numbers of original and converted image files. The option also confusingly mentions saving files to EBS store at the end, despite mentioning EFS.

A company has more than 5 TB of file data on Windows file servers that run on premises. Users and applications interact with the data each day.

The company is moving its Windows workloads to AWS. As the company continues this process, the company requires access to AWS and on-premises file storage with minimum latency. The company needs a solution that minimizes operational overhead and requires no significant changes to the existing file access patterns. The company uses an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection for connectivity to AWS.

What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Deploy and configure Amazon FSx for Windows File Server on AWS. Move the on-premises file data to FSx for Windows File Server. Reconfigure the workloads to use FSx for Windows File Server on AWS.
- [ ] B. Deploy and configure an Amazon S3 File Gateway on premises. Move the on-premises file data to the S3 File Gateway. Reconfigure the on-premises workloads and the cloud workloads to use the S3 File Gateway.
- [ ] C. Deploy and configure an Amazon S3 File Gateway on premises. Move the on-premises file data to Amazon S3. Reconfigure the workloads to use either Amazon S3 directly or the S3 File Gateway. depending on each workload's location.
- [ ] D. Deploy and configure Amazon FSx for Windows File Server on AWS. Deploy and configure an Amazon FSx File Gateway on premises. Move the on-premises file data to the FSx File Gateway. Configure the cloud workloads to use FSx for Windows File Server on AWS. Configure the on-premises workloads to use the FSx File Gateway.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] D. Deploy and configure Amazon FSx for Windows File Server on AWS. Deploy and configure an Amazon FSx File Gateway on premises. Move the on-premises file data to the FSx File Gateway. Configure the cloud workloads to use FSx for Windows File Server on AWS. Configure the on-premises workloads to use the FSx File Gateway.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Hybrid Access with Minimized Latency: The core requirement is to provide low-latency access to file storage for both on-premises users/applications and new workloads being moved to AWS during the migration process.
- [ ] Amazon FSx for Windows File Server in AWS: This provides a fully managed, native Windows file system in the AWS Cloud, suitable for the Windows workloads being migrated. It supports SMB, Active Directory integration, and other Windows-native features.
- [ ] Amazon FSx File Gateway On-Premises: The Amazon FSx File Gateway (a specific type of AWS Storage Gateway) is deployed on-premises. It provides low-latency access for on-premises users and applications to their file data that is stored and managed in Amazon FSx for Windows File Server in the cloud. It does this by caching frequently accessed data locally on the gateway.
- [ ] Preserves Access Patterns: On-premises users continue to access files via SMB through the FSx File Gateway, and cloud workloads access the data directly from FSx for Windows File Server via SMB. This requires "no significant changes to the existing file access patterns."
- [ ] Minimizes Operational Overhead: Both FSx for Windows File Server and FSx File Gateway are managed services, reducing the operational burden on the company.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: This option describes a full migration of data and workloads to FSx for Windows File Server on AWS. It doesn't address the requirement for on-premises workloads to maintain low-latency access to the file storage during the transition period. It's a destination state, not a hybrid solution for the migration process.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: An Amazon S3 File Gateway provides an SMB interface to data stored in Amazon S3. While it can offer on-premises caching, Amazon FSx for Windows File Server (as in option D) provides a richer set of Windows-native file system features (like DFS Namespaces, fine-grained ACLs, shadow copies) that are often critical for Windows workloads. The FSx File Gateway is specifically optimized to work with FSx for Windows File Server, making it a more tailored solution for this scenario.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: This also uses an S3 File Gateway. Requiring workloads to use Amazon S3 directly (for some workloads) would change the file access pattern from SMB to S3 API calls, which contradicts the requirement of "no significant changes to the existing file access patterns."

A hospital recently deployed a RESTful API with Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda. The hospital uses API Gateway and Lambda to upload reports that are in PDF format and JPEG format. The hospital needs to modify the Lambda code to identify protected health information (PHI) in the reports.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- [ ] A. Use existing Python libraries to extract the text from the reports and to identify the PHI from the extracted text.
- [ ] B. Use Amazon Textract to extract the text from the reports. Use Amazon SageMaker to identify the PHI from the extracted text.
- [ ] C. Use Amazon Textract to extract the text from the reports. Use Amazon Comprehend Medical to identify the PHI from the extracted text.
- [ ] D. Use Amazon Rekognition to extract the text from the reports. Use Amazon Comprehend Medical to identify the PHI from the extracted text.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] C. Use Amazon Textract to extract the text from the reports. Use Amazon Comprehend Medical to identify the PHI from the extracted text.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Amazon Textract for Text Extraction: Amazon Textract is a machine learning (ML) service that automatically extracts text, handwriting, and data from scanned documents, PDFs, and images (like JPEGs). This is ideal for getting the textual content out of the "PDF format and JPEG format" reports.   
- [ ] Amazon Comprehend Medical for PHI Identification: Amazon Comprehend Medical is a HIPAA-eligible natural language processing (NLP) service that uses ML to extract relevant medical information, including Protected Health Information (PHI), from unstructured text. It is specifically trained for medical text and can identify entities like PHI, medical conditions, medications, etc. This directly addresses the need to "identify protected health information (PHI) in the reports."
- [ ] Least Operational Overhead: Using these two fully managed AWS AI services (Textract and Comprehend Medical) within the Lambda function requires significantly less development effort and ongoing operational overhead compared to building custom solutions. There's no need to train custom models or manage underlying infrastructure for these tasks.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Relying on existing Python libraries for both text extraction (from potentially complex PDFs and image-based JPEGs which would require OCR) and accurate PHI identification would involve significant development effort, library selection, integration, testing, and maintenance. Identifying PHI accurately with general-purpose libraries can be challenging. This approach does not offer the "LEAST operational overhead."
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: While Amazon Textract is appropriate for text extraction, Amazon SageMaker is a platform for building, training, and deploying custom machine learning models. Using SageMaker to identify PHI would mean the hospital needs to develop, train, and manage its own ML model for this purpose. This is a complex and time-consuming process with high development and operational overhead, directly contradicting the "LEAST operational overhead" requirement.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: While Amazon Rekognition can detect text in images (and would work for JPEGs), Amazon Textract is generally more specialized and robust for extracting text from document formats like PDFs and JPEGs containing forms or dense text. Amazon Comprehend Medical is the correct choice for PHI identification. The combination of Textract and Comprehend Medical (as in option C) is more specifically tailored for extracting text from documents and then identifying medical information.

  <summary>Question 66</summary>

A company has an application that generates a large number of files, each approximately 5 MB in size. The files are stored in Amazon S3. Company policy requires the files to be stored for 4 years before they can be deleted. Immediate accessibility is always required as the files contain critical business data that is not easy to reproduce. The files are frequently accessed in the first 30 days of the object creation but are rarely accessed after the first 30 days.

Which storage solution is MOST cost-effective?

- [ ] A. Create an S3 bucket lifecycle policy to move files from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier 30 days from object creation. Delete the files 4 years after object creation.
- [ ] B. Create an S3 bucket lifecycle policy to move files from S3 Standard to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) 30 days from object creation. Delete the files 4 years after object creation.
- [ ] C. Create an S3 bucket lifecycle policy to move files from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) 30 days from object creation. Delete the files 4 years after object creation.
- [ ] D. Create an S3 bucket lifecycle policy to move files from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) 30 days from object creation. Move the files to S3 Glacier 4 years after object creation.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] C. Create an S3 bucket lifecycle policy to move files from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) 30 days from object creation. Delete the files 4 years after object creation.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Initial Storage in S3 Standard: For the first 30 days, when files are "frequently accessed," storing them in Amazon S3 Standard is appropriate as it offers low latency and high throughput performance for frequently accessed data.
- [ ] Transition to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA): After 30 days, the files are "rarely accessed," but "Immediate accessibility is always required." S3 Standard-IA is designed for data that is accessed less frequently but requires millisecond access when needed. It offers a lower storage cost than S3 Standard, making it cost-effective for this phase. It also maintains high durability by storing data across multiple Availability Zones.
- [ ] Lifecycle Policy for Automation: An S3 Lifecycle policy can be configured to automatically transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-IA after 30 days. The same policy can also be configured to delete the objects after 4 years, meeting the company's retention policy.
- [ ] Cost-Effectiveness and Requirements Met: This solution balances the need for immediate accessibility throughout the 4-year retention period with cost optimization by moving data to a lower-cost tier after the initial frequent access period.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Amazon S3 Glacier (referring to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive) is designed for archiving, and data retrieval typically takes minutes to hours. This does not meet the requirement that "Immediate accessibility is always required" for the files throughout their 4-year lifecycle. (Note: S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval offers immediate access from an archive tier, but S3 Standard-IA is generally more suitable for infrequently accessed data that isn't cold enough for a dedicated archive tier if immediate access is paramount and access is just infrequent, not archival-rare).
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) stores data in only a single Availability Zone. While it is a lower-cost option, it is not suitable for "critical business data that is not easy to reproduce" because if that single Availability Zone fails, the data would be lost. This does not provide the necessary durability for critical data.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: The company policy requires the files to be "deleted" after 4 years, not moved to another storage tier like S3 Glacier. This option introduces an unnecessary archival step instead of deletion after the 4-year retention period.

  <summary>Question 67</summary>

A company hosts an application on multiple Amazon EC2 instances. The application processes messages from an Amazon SQS queue, writes to an Amazon RDS table, and deletes the message from the queue. Occasional duplicate records are found in the RDS table. The SQS queue does not contain any duplicate messages.

What should a solutions architect do to ensure messages are being processed once only?

- [ ] A. Use the CreateQueue API call to create a new queue.
- [ ] B. Use the AddPermission API call to add appropriate permissions.
- [ ] C. Use the ReceiveMessage API call to set an appropriate wait time.
- [ ] D. Use the ChangeMessageVisibility API call to increase the visibility timeout.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] D. Use the ChangeMessageVisibility API call to increase the visibility timeout.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Understanding SQS Message Lifecycle and Visibility Timeout: When a consumer (in this case, an EC2 instance) retrieves a message from an SQS queue, the message isn't immediately deleted. Instead, it becomes "invisible" for a period called the visibility timeout. During this time, other consumers cannot see or process this message. The consumer is expected to process the message and then explicitly delete it from the queue.
- [ ] Cause of Duplicate Processing: If the application takes longer to process the message (write to RDS and then delete from SQS) than the configured visibility timeout, the message will become visible again in the queue. Another EC2 instance (or even the same instance if it retries) might then pick up this "reappeared" message and process it again, leading to duplicate records in the RDS table. The problem states the queue itself doesn't have duplicates, so the issue is with the processing.
- [ ] Increasing Visibility Timeout: By using the ChangeMessageVisibility API call (or configuring it on the queue settings) to increase the visibility timeout to a value that is safely longer than the maximum expected time to process and delete a message, you ensure that a message does not become visible again prematurely. This gives the initial processing instance enough time to complete its work and delete the message, preventing other instances from picking it up and causing duplicate processing.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Creating a new queue does not solve the underlying problem of how messages are being processed from the existing queue. The issue is not with the queue itself containing duplicates but with the processing logic leading to messages being processed more than once.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: The AddPermission API call is used to grant other AWS accounts or services permissions to use the SQS queue. Incorrect permissions would likely lead to an inability to process messages or access denied errors, rather than causing duplicate processing of successfully retrieved messages.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Setting an appropriate wait time for the ReceiveMessage API call enables long polling. Long polling reduces the number of empty responses when polling the queue and can make message retrieval more efficient and cost-effective. However, it does not directly prevent a message from being processed multiple times if the visibility timeout is too short for the actual processing duration.

A solutions architect is designing a new hybrid architecture to extend a company's on-premises infrastructure to AWS. The company requires a highly available connection with consistent low latency to an AWS Region. The company needs to minimize costs and is willing to accept slower traffic if the primary connection fails.

What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Provision an AWS Direct Connect connection to a Region. Provision a VPN connection as a backup if the primary Direct Connect connection fails.
- [ ] B. Provision a VPN tunnel connection to a Region for private connectivity. Provision a second VPN tunnel for private connectivity and as a backup if the primary VPN connection fails.
- [ ] C. Provision an AWS Direct Connect connection to a Region. Provision a second Direct Connect connection to the same Region as a backup if the primary Direct Connect connection fails.
- [ ] D. Provision an AWS Direct Connect connection to a Region. Use the Direct Connect failover attribute from the AWS CLI to automatically create a backup connection if the primary Direct Connect connection fails.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] A. Provision an AWS Direct Connect connection to a Region. Provision a VPN connection as a backup if the primary Direct Connect connection fails.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] AWS Direct Connect for Primary, Low-Latency Connection: AWS Direct Connect provides a dedicated physical network connection from your on-premises environment to AWS. This is ideal for achieving "consistent low latency" and can be configured for high availability (e.g., using redundant connections or connections to different Direct Connect locations).
- [ ] VPN as a Cost-Effective Backup: An AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection routes traffic over the public internet. It is a more cost-effective option than a second Direct Connect connection and can serve as a reliable backup.
- [ ] Meeting Cost and Failover Requirements: The company "needs to minimize costs and is willing to accept slower traffic if the primary connection fails." Using a VPN as a backup to Direct Connect aligns with this. The VPN will typically have higher latency and lower throughput than Direct Connect, but it provides a failover path at a lower cost than a redundant Direct Connect link. Failover from Direct Connect to VPN can be configured using dynamic routing (BGP).

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option B is wrong because: While using two VPN tunnels can provide redundancy, VPN connections rely on the public internet and may not consistently provide the "consistent low latency" required for the primary connection, especially compared to what Direct Connect offers.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Provisioning a second AWS Direct Connect connection for backup provides the highest level of availability and consistent performance for the backup path. However, it is also the most expensive option for a backup connection. This contradicts the requirement to "minimize costs," especially given the company's willingness to accept slower traffic on failover.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: There is no such thing as a "Direct Connect failover attribute from the AWS CLI to automatically create a backup connection." Failover mechanisms for Direct Connect involve network routing configurations (typically using BGP) to a pre-provisioned backup path (like another Direct Connect connection or a VPN). The backup connection needs to exist beforehand; it's not automatically created upon failure by a CLI attribute.

A company is running a business-critical web application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The EC2 instances are in an Auto Scaling group. The application uses an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database that is deployed in a single Availability Zone. The company wants the application to be highly available with minimum downtime and minimum loss of data.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational effort?

- [ ] A. Place the EC2 instances in different AWS Regions. Use Amazon Route 53 health checks to redirect traffic. Use Aurora PostgreSQL Cross-Region Replication.
- [ ] B. Configure the Auto Scaling group to use multiple Availability Zones. Configure the database as Multi-AZ. Configure an Amazon RDS Proxy instance for the database.
- [ ] C. Configure the Auto Scaling group to use one Availability Zone. Generate hourly snapshots of the database. Recover the database from the snapshots in the event of a failure.
- [ ] D. Configure the Auto Scaling group to use multiple AWS Regions. Write the data from the application to Amazon S3. Use S3 Event Notifications to launch an AWS Lambda function to write the data to the database.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] B. Configure the Auto Scaling group to use multiple Availability Zones. Configure the database as Multi-AZ. Configure an Amazon RDS Proxy instance for the database.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Auto Scaling Group Across Multiple Availability Zones: Distributing the EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within the same region ensures that the application tier remains available even if one AZ experiences an outage. The Application Load Balancer will route traffic to healthy instances in the available AZs.
- [ ] Aurora PostgreSQL Multi-AZ Deployment: The current database is in a single AZ, which is a single point of failure. Configuring the Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database as a Multi-AZ deployment is crucial for high availability. Aurora automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous standby replica in a different AZ. In case of a primary database failure or an AZ outage, Aurora performs an automatic failover to the standby replica, typically within minutes, thus minimizing downtime and ensuring minimum data loss (RPO is near zero for synchronous replication).
- [ ] Amazon RDS Proxy: Amazon RDS Proxy is a fully managed, highly available database proxy that sits between your application and your RDS/Aurora database. It helps improve application resilience by managing and sharing database connections. During a database failover (like an Aurora Multi-AZ failover), RDS Proxy can maintain open application connections and seamlessly connect to the newly promoted database instance, reducing the impact of failovers on the application and often leading to faster recovery times for the application. This further contributes to "minimum downtime."
- [ ] Least Operational Effort: This solution leverages managed AWS services (Auto Scaling, Aurora Multi-AZ, RDS Proxy) that automate many of the complexities associated with achieving high availability, requiring the least operational effort from the company.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: While deploying across multiple AWS Regions with Cross-Region Replication provides disaster recovery capabilities, it is significantly more complex and involves higher operational effort than a Multi-AZ deployment within a single region for achieving high availability. Aurora Cross-Region Replication is asynchronous, which means there could be some data loss (RPO > 0) in a failover scenario. This is more of a DR strategy than a primary HA strategy aimed at "minimum downtime and minimum loss of data" which is first typically addressed by Multi-AZ.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Configuring the Auto Scaling group in a single Availability Zone makes the application tier vulnerable to an AZ failure. Generating hourly snapshots and recovering from them means a potential data loss of up to one hour (RPO = 1 hour) and a recovery time (RTO) that would likely be much longer than "minimum downtime" allows for a business-critical application.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Deploying across multiple AWS Regions for the Auto Scaling group is complex for high availability. Using Amazon S3 as an intermediary data store before writing to the database introduces unnecessary latency, complexity, and potential points of failure in the critical data path for a transactional application. This is not a standard or efficient pattern for achieving high database availability.

  <summary>Question 70</summary>

A company's HTTP application is behind a Network Load Balancer (NLB). The NLB's target group is configured to use an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group with multiple EC2 instances that run the web service. The company notices that the NLB is not detecting HTTP errors for the application. These errors require a manual restart of the EC2 instances that run the web service. The company needs to improve the application's availability without writing custom scripts or code.

What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Enable HTTP health checks on the NLB, supplying the URL of the company's application.
- [ ] B. Add a cron job to the EC2 instances to check the local application's logs once each minute. If HTTP errors are detected. the application will restart.
- [ ] C. Replace the NLB with an Application Load Balancer. Enable HTTP health checks by supplying the URL of the company's application. Configure an Auto Scaling action to replace unhealthy instances.
- [ ] D. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that monitors the UnhealthyHostCount metric for the NLB. Configure an Auto Scaling action to replace unhealthy instances when the alarm is in the ALARM state.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] C. Replace the NLB with an Application Load Balancer. Enable HTTP health checks by supplying the URL of the company's application. Configure an Auto Scaling action to replace unhealthy instances.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Application-Level Health Checks with ALB: The problem states that the Network Load Balancer (NLB) is not detecting HTTP errors. NLBs operate at Layer 4 (transport layer) and perform health checks at the TCP level or basic HTTP checks. Application Load Balancers (ALBs), however, operate at Layer 7 (application layer) and can perform more sophisticated HTTP/HTTPS health checks. ALBs can check for specific HTTP status codes (e.g., expecting a 200 OK from a specific path) and can more reliably detect application-level errors. Replacing the NLB with an ALB allows for proper detection of HTTP errors.
- [ ] Auto Scaling Based on ALB Health Checks: Once an ALB is in place with appropriate HTTP health checks, it will mark instances as unhealthy if they return HTTP errors. The EC2 Auto Scaling group can then be configured to use these ELB (ALB) health checks. When an instance is marked unhealthy by the ALB, the Auto Scaling group can automatically terminate that instance and launch a new one to replace it. This improves application availability by automating the recovery from failing instances.
- [ ] No Custom Scripts or Code: This solution uses built-in AWS features (ALB health checks and Auto Scaling group actions) and does not require writing any custom scripts or code for health detection or instance remediation.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: While NLBs do offer HTTP/HTTPS health checks, they are generally less granular than ALB health checks for detecting application-specific HTTP errors. If the NLB is currently "not detecting HTTP errors," simply enabling or tweaking its existing HTTP health checks might not be sufficient if the issue lies in the depth of checking required, which ALBs handle better.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: Adding a cron job to check logs and restart the application involves writing custom scripts, which directly contradicts the requirement to achieve the solution "without writing custom scripts or code."
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: If the NLB's health checks are not correctly identifying the instances as unhealthy when they are returning HTTP errors (as stated in the problem: "NLB is not detecting HTTP errors"), then the UnhealthyHostCount metric for the NLB will not be accurate. An alarm based on this potentially inaccurate metric would not reliably trigger the Auto Scaling action to replace the genuinely unhealthy instances. The root cause of the health check inadequacy needs to be addressed first.

A company runs a shopping application that uses Amazon DynamoDB to store customer information. In case of data corruption, a solutions architect needs to design a solution that meets a recovery point objective (RPO) of 15 minutes and a recovery time objective (RTO) of 1 hour.

What should the solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Configure DynamoDB global tables. For RPO recovery, point the application to a different AWS Region.
- [ ] B. Configure DynamoDB point-in-time recovery. For RPO recovery, restore to the desired point in time.
- [ ] C. Export the DynamoDB data to Amazon S3 Glacier on a daily basis. For RPO recovery, import the data from S3 Glacier to DynamoDB.
- [ ] D. Schedule Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshots for the DynamoDB table every 15 minutes. For RPO recovery, restore the DynamoDB table by using the EBS snapshot.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] B. Configure DynamoDB point-in-time recovery. For RPO recovery, restore to the desired point in time.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR): Amazon DynamoDB point-in-time recovery (PITR) provides continuous backups of your table data. When enabled, DynamoDB backs up your data with per-second granularity, and you can restore your table to any single second during the preceding 35 days.
- [ ] Meeting RPO of 15 minutes: Since PITR allows restoration to any second within the retention period, it can easily meet a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of 15 minutes. If data corruption occurs, you can restore the table to a state just moments before the corruption event.
- [ ] Meeting RTO of 1 hour: Restoring a DynamoDB table using PITR creates a new table with the restored data. The time it takes to restore a table depends on its size and other factors, but for many common table sizes, the restoration process can be completed well within a 1-hour Recovery Time Objective (RTO).
- [ ] Designed for Data Corruption: PITR is specifically designed to protect against accidental writes or deletes (i.e., data corruption) by allowing you to revert the table to a previous state.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: DynamoDB global tables provide a multi-region, multi-active database solution, primarily for disaster recovery from regional outages and for providing low-latency access to globally distributed users. If data corruption occurs in one region, that corrupted data will replicate to the other regions. Global tables do not inherently protect against logical data corruption within the table itself by allowing a rollback to a previous point in time.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Exporting DynamoDB data to Amazon S3 Glacier on a daily basis would result in an RPO of up to 24 hours, which does not meet the 15-minute RPO requirement. Additionally, retrieving data from S3 Glacier typically takes minutes to hours, and then importing it back into DynamoDB would add further to the recovery time, likely exceeding the 1-hour RTO.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service. Users do not directly manage its underlying storage with Amazon EBS volumes in a way that would allow them to take EBS snapshots. DynamoDB has its own native backup and restore mechanisms, such as on-demand backups and point-in-time recovery. This option describes an incorrect method for backing up DynamoDB.

A company runs a photo processing application that needs to frequently upload and download pictures from Amazon S3 buckets that are located in the same AWS Region. A solutions architect has noticed an increased cost in data transfer fees and needs to implement a solution to reduce these costs.

How can the solutions architect meet this requirement?

- [ ] A. Deploy Amazon API Gateway into a public subnet and adjust the route table to route S3 calls through it.
- [ ] B. Deploy a NAT gateway into a public subnet and attach an endpoint policy that allows access to the S3 buckets.
- [ ] C. Deploy the application into a public subnet and allow it to route through an internet gateway to access the S3 buckets.
- [ ] D. Deploy an S3 VPC gateway endpoint into the VPC and attach an endpoint policy that allows access to the S3 buckets.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] D. Deploy an S3 VPC gateway endpoint into the VPC and attach an endpoint policy that allows access to the S3 buckets.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Reducing S3 Data Transfer Costs within a VPC: When EC2 instances (or other resources within a VPC) access Amazon S3 in the same region, traffic might route through a NAT Gateway or an Internet Gateway if a private connection isn't established. This can lead to data transfer costs (specifically, NAT Gateway data processing charges).
- [ ] S3 VPC Gateway Endpoint: An S3 VPC gateway endpoint enables instances in your VPC to use their private IP addresses to access Amazon S3 directly, without needing an Internet Gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Traffic between your VPC and S3 does not leave the Amazon network.   
- [ ] Cost Savings: Crucially, data transferred between your EC2 instances and S3 through a gateway VPC endpoint within the same AWS Region does not incur data transfer charges or NAT gateway processing charges. This directly addresses the requirement to "reduce these costs."
Endpoint Policy for Security: An endpoint policy can be attached to the S3 gateway endpoint to control access to S3 buckets from your VPC, providing an additional layer of security.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Amazon API Gateway is a service for creating, managing, and securing APIs. Using it as a proxy for S3 calls primarily to reduce data transfer costs for an application that directly interacts with S3 for uploads/downloads is an overly complex and inappropriate solution. It would likely introduce its own costs and latency.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: If the application instances are in private subnets, they might already be using a NAT gateway to access S3 (which is causing the data transfer fees). Deploying or continuing to use a NAT gateway for S3 access will incur data processing charges for traffic passing through it. A VPC gateway endpoint for S3 bypasses the NAT gateway for S3 traffic, thus saving those costs.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: If application instances are in a public subnet and use an Internet Gateway to access S3, this avoids NAT gateway charges. However, using a gateway VPC endpoint (Option D) is still the most direct and recommended way to ensure private connectivity to S3 and eliminate any potential data transfer costs for S3 access within the same region. It also allows instances to reside in private subnets for better security, while still accessing S3 cost-effectively.

A company recently launched Linux-based application instances on Amazon EC2 in a private subnet and launched a Linux-based bastion host on an Amazon EC2 instance in a public subnet of a VPC. A solutions architect needs to connect from the on-premises network, through the company's internet connection, to the bastion host, and to the application servers. The solutions architect must make sure that the security groups of all the EC2 instances will allow that access.

Which combination of steps should the solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

- [ ] A. Replace the current security group of the bastion host with one that only allows inbound access from the application instances.
- [ ] B. Replace the current security group of the bastion host with one that only allows inbound access from the internal IP range for the company.
- [ ] C. Replace the current security group of the bastion host with one that only allows inbound access from the external IP range for the company.
- [ ] D. Replace the current security group of the application instances with one that allows inbound SSH access from only the private IP address of the bastion host.
- [ ] E. Replace the current security group of the application instances with one that allows inbound SSH access from only the public IP address of the bastion host.

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] C. Replace the current security group of the bastion host with one that only allows inbound access from the external IP range for the company.
- [ ] D. Replace the current security group of the application instances with one that allows inbound SSH access from only the private IP address of the bastion host.

Why these are the correct answers:

This question describes a typical bastion host setup for secure SSH access to instances in private subnets.

C. Replace the current security group of the bastion host with one that only allows inbound access from the external IP range for the company.
- [ ] Bastion Host Security: The bastion host is in a public subnet and serves as the entry point from the internet (or an on-premises network via the internet) into the VPC.
- [ ] Its security group should be configured to allow inbound SSH traffic (typically on port 22 for Linux) only from the known public IP address range of the company's on-premises network.
- [ ] This restricts access to the bastion host itself, preventing unauthorized connection attempts from the wider internet.

D. Replace the current security group of the application instances with one that allows inbound SSH access from only the private IP address of the bastion host.
- [ ] Application Instance Security: The application instances are in a private subnet and should not be directly accessible from the internet.
- [ ] Access to these instances should be routed through the bastion host. Therefore, the security group for the application instances should allow inbound SSH traffic (port 22) only from the bastion host.
- [ ] This is best achieved by specifying the private IP address of the bastion host as the source in the inbound rule (or, even more securely and flexibly, by referencing the security group ID of the bastion host, though that specific wording isn't an option here, the private IP achieves the same goal from a specific instance).

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: The bastion host is the entry point; it does not need inbound access from the application instances it is designed to protect. Traffic flows from the on-premises network to the bastion, then from the bastion to the application instances.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: "Internal IP range for the company" usually refers to the company's on-premises private IP addresses. These private IPs are not routable over the public internet to reach the bastion host's public IP. The bastion host's security group needs to allow traffic from the company's external (public) IP range.
- [ ] Option E is wrong because: When the bastion host initiates an SSH connection to an application instance in a private subnet within the same VPC, the source IP address of that connection will be the bastion host's private IP address, not its public IP address. Therefore, the application instances' security group must allow inbound SSH from the bastion's private IP.

A solutions architect is designing a two-tier web application. The application consists of a public-facing web tier hosted on Amazon EC2 in public subnets. The database tier consists of Microsoft SQL Server running on Amazon EC2 in a private subnet. Security is a high priority for the company.

How should security groups be configured in this situation? (Choose two.)

- [ ] A. Configure the security group for the web tier to allow inbound traffic on port 443 from 0.0.0.0/0.
- [ ] B. Configure the security group for the web tier to allow outbound traffic on port 443 from 0.0.0.0/0.
- [ ] C. Configure the security group for the database tier to allow inbound traffic on port 1433 from the security group for the web tier.
- [ ] D. Configure the security group for the database tier to allow outbound traffic on ports 443 and 1433 to the security group for the web tier.
- [ ] E. Configure the security group for the database tier to allow inbound traffic on ports 443 and 1433 from the security group for the web tier.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] A. Configure the security group for the web tier to allow inbound traffic on port 443 from 0.0.0.0/0.
- [ ] C. Configure the security group for the database tier to allow inbound traffic on port 1433 from the security group for the web tier.

Why these are the correct answers:

This setup describes a standard best practice for securing a two-tier web application using security groups:

A. Configure the security group for the web tier to allow inbound traffic on port 443 from 0.0.0.0/0.
- [ ] Public Access to Web Tier: The web tier is public-facing and needs to accept incoming HTTPS traffic from users on the internet.
- [ ] Port 443 is the standard port for HTTPS. 0.0.0.0/0 represents any IP address, allowing global access to the web application over HTTPS. (Often, HTTP on port 80 would also be allowed, typically with a redirect to HTTPS, but allowing 443 from anywhere is essential for public web access).

C. Configure the security group for the database tier to allow inbound traffic on port 1433 from the security group for the web tier.
- [ ] Restricted Access to Database Tier: The database tier is in a private subnet and should only be accessible by the application's web tier.
- [ ] Microsoft SQL Server typically listens on port 1433.
- [ ] Security Group Referencing: A security best practice is to configure the database tier's security group to allow inbound traffic on port 1433 only from the security group that is attached to the web tier EC2 instances.
- [ ] This ensures that only the web servers can initiate connections to the database, providing tight network isolation.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option B is wrong because: Security groups are stateful. If inbound traffic on port 443 is allowed (as in option A), the corresponding outbound response traffic is automatically allowed. Outbound rules are typically configured for traffic initiated by the instances in the security group. Specifying a source IP (0.0.0.0/0) for an outbound rule in this context is not how it's typically defined; you define the destination and port for outbound traffic.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: The primary concern for connectivity between the web and database tiers is allowing the web tier to initiate connections to the database tier. While the database tier will send outbound traffic in response to these connections (which is statefully allowed), explicitly defining outbound rules from the database to the web tier's security group on ports 443 and 1433 is not the standard way to enable the required web-to-database communication. The critical rule is the inbound rule on the database security group.
- [ ] Option E is wrong because: The database tier (Microsoft SQL Server) listens for database connections on port 1433. It does not need to accept inbound traffic on port 443 (HTTPS) from the web tier for standard database communication. Port 443 is for web traffic.

A company wants to move a multi-tiered application from on premises to the AWS Cloud to improve the application's performance. The application consists of application tiers that communicate with each other by way of RESTful services. Transactions are dropped when one tier becomes overloaded. A solutions architect must design a solution that resolves these issues and modernizes the application.

Which solution meets these requirements and is the MOST operationally efficient?

- [ ] A. Use Amazon API Gateway and direct transactions to the AWS Lambda functions as the application layer. Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) as the communication layer between application services.
- [ ] B. Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to analyze the application performance history to determine the servers' peak utilization during the performance failures. Increase the size of the application server's Amazon EC2 instances to meet the peak requirements.
- [ ] C. Use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to handle the messaging between application servers running on Amazon EC2 in an Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the SNS queue length and scale up and down as required.
- [ ] D. Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to handle the messaging between application servers running on Amazon EC2 in an Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the SQS queue length and scale up when communication failures are detected.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] A. Use Amazon API Gateway and direct transactions to the AWS Lambda functions as the application layer. Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) as the communication layer between application services.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Modernization with Serverless Components: This solution proposes a significant modernization by moving towards a serverless architecture.
- [ ] Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda: Using API Gateway to expose RESTful services and AWS Lambda functions to implement the application logic for each tier is highly scalable, resilient, and "operationally efficient." There are no servers to manage for this part of the application, as AWS handles the underlying infrastructure, scaling, and availability.
- [ ] Resolving Dropped Transactions with SQS: The problem states "Transactions are dropped when one tier becomes overloaded." Using Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) as the communication layer between these application services (implemented as Lambda functions or other components) provides a durable buffer. If a downstream service is overloaded, messages (transactions) can be reliably queued in SQS until the service can process them, preventing them from being dropped. This decouples the application tiers.
- [ ] Improved Performance and Scalability: API Gateway and Lambda can scale automatically to handle varying loads. SQS provides a scalable and reliable messaging backbone.
- [ ] MOST Operationally Efficient: A serverless architecture with managed services like API Gateway, Lambda, and SQS generally offers the highest operational efficiency because it minimizes infrastructure management tasks (provisioning, patching, scaling servers).

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option B is wrong because: Simply increasing the size of EC2 instances (vertical scaling) is a traditional approach that might not be the most cost-effective or elastic solution for handling variable loads. It doesn't fundamentally "modernize" the application architecture or address the dropped transactions issue through decoupling in an optimal way. It can lead to over-provisioning and still doesn't prevent drops if synchronous calls between tiers remain the bottleneck.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: While Amazon SNS is a messaging service, it's primarily a publish/subscribe system designed for fanning out messages to multiple subscribers. For buffering transactions between specific application tiers where processing order or guaranteed delivery to a worker pool is important, SQS is generally a more suitable choice. Also, SNS topics don't have a "queue length" in the same way SQS queues do for direct monitoring and scaling of worker tiers. This option still relies on EC2 instances, making it less operationally efficient than option A.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Using SQS between EC2-based application servers is an improvement over direct REST calls for preventing dropped transactions. However, option A offers a more complete modernization and higher operational efficiency by moving the application tiers themselves to serverless components (API Gateway and Lambda) in addition to using SQS for inter-service communication. Managing EC2 instances, even in an Auto Scaling group, involves more operational overhead than a fully serverless backend.

A company receives 10 TB of instrumentation data each day from several machines located at a single factory. The data consists of JSON files stored on a storage area network (SAN) in an on-premises data center located within the factory. The company wants to send this data to Amazon S3 where it can be accessed by several additional systems that provide critical near-real-time analytics. A secure transfer is important because the data is considered sensitive.

Which solution offers the MOST reliable data transfer?

- [ ] A. AWS DataSync over public internet
- [ ] B. AWS DataSync over AWS Direct Connect
- [ ] C. AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) over public internet
- [ ] D. AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) over AWS Direct Connect

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] B. AWS DataSync over AWS Direct Connect

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] AWS DataSync for File Transfer: AWS DataSync is a data transfer service specifically designed to simplify, automate, and accelerate moving large amounts of data between on-premises storage systems (like a SAN storing JSON files) and AWS storage services such as Amazon S3. It is well-suited for transferring 10 TB of data daily.
- [ ] AWS Direct Connect for Reliability and Security: AWS Direct Connect provides a dedicated, private network connection from your on-premises data center to AWS. Transferring data over Direct Connect offers:
- [ ] Reliability: More consistent network performance and higher throughput compared to the public internet, which is crucial for transferring large volumes of time-sensitive data reliably.
- [ ] Security: A private, dedicated path that does not traverse the public internet, enhancing security for sensitive data. DataSync encrypts data in transit, and using it over Direct Connect further secures the path.
- [ ] This combination addresses the need for a "secure transfer" and the "MOST reliable data transfer."
- [ ] Enabling Near-Real-Time Analytics: By efficiently and reliably transferring data to Amazon S3, downstream systems can then access this data for "critical near-real-time analytics."

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: While AWS DataSync is the correct service for the data transfer, sending 10 TB of sensitive data daily "over public internet" is generally less reliable (due to potential network congestion and variability) and less secure than using a dedicated connection like AWS Direct Connect.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) is designed for migrating databases to or within AWS. It is not the appropriate tool for transferring JSON files from a storage area network (SAN) to Amazon S3. Using DMS over the public internet also shares the reliability and security concerns mentioned for option A.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: As with option C, AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) is not the correct tool for transferring file-based data from a SAN. The nature of the data (JSON files on a SAN) points to a file transfer solution like AWS DataSync.

- [ ] Firehose has a built-in feature to invoke an AWS Lambda function to perform data transformations on the records as they pass through.
- [ ] This meets the requirement to "transform data as the data is streamed."
- [ ] Storage with Amazon S3: Kinesis Data Firehose can then reliably deliver the transformed data to Amazon S3, which serves as a scalable and durable storage solution.
- [ ] Least Operational Overhead: This architecture primarily uses managed services (API Gateway, Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Data Firehose, Lambda, S3), which significantly reduces the need to provision, manage, or scale underlying infrastructure.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Deploying an Amazon EC2 instance to host the API introduces operational overhead for managing that instance (patching, scaling, availability). API Gateway (as in option C) is a serverless alternative that eliminates this overhead. The rest of the pipeline is similar to option C, but the EC2 component makes it less operationally efficient.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: Similar to option A, using an EC2 instance for the API has higher operational overhead. Additionally, AWS Glue is primarily an ETL (extract, transform, load) service, generally used for batch or more complex streaming ETL jobs. While it can perform transformations, using Kinesis Data Firehose with Lambda for in-stream transformation of real-time API data is often a more lightweight and direct approach for "least operational overhead" in this specific scenario. Sending data directly from an API to AWS Glue for real-time streaming transformation is not as common or straightforward as using the Kinesis suite.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Sending data directly from API Gateway to AWS Glue for real-time data transformation is not a typical or directly supported high-throughput streaming pattern. Kinesis Data Streams and Kinesis Data Firehose are purpose-built for ingesting and processing streaming data from sources like API Gateway before it lands in a data store or is further processed by services like Glue for more complex ETL.

  <summary>Question 78</summary>

A company needs to keep user transaction data in an Amazon DynamoDB table. The company must retain the data for 7 years.

What is the MOST operationally efficient solution that meets these requirements?

- [ ] A. Use DynamoDB point-in-time recovery to back up the table continuously.
- [ ] B. Use AWS Backup to create backup schedules and retention policies for the table.
- [ ] C. Create an on-demand backup of the table by using the DynamoDB console. Store the backup in an Amazon S3 bucket. Set an S3 Lifecycle configuration for the S3 bucket.
- [ ] D. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule to invoke an AWS Lambda function. Configure the Lambda function to back up the table and to store the backup in an Amazon S3 bucket. Set an S3 Lifecycle configuration for the S3 bucket.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] B. Use AWS Backup to create backup schedules and retention policies for the table.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] AWS Backup for Centralized and Automated Backups: AWS Backup is a fully managed backup service that makes it easy to centralize and automate data protection across AWS services, including Amazon DynamoDB.   
- [ ] Backup Schedules and Retention Policies: With AWS Backup, you can create backup plans that define automated backup schedules (e.g., daily, weekly) and, crucially, set retention policies.
- [ ] You can configure these retention policies to keep backups for extended periods, such as the required 7 years.
- [ ] AWS Backup will manage the lifecycle of these backups, including their expiration.
- [ ] MOST Operationally Efficient: Using AWS Backup is highly operationally efficient for long-term retention requirements. It automates the entire backup lifecycle, from creation to expiration, and provides a central place to manage and monitor backups. This avoids the need for manual processes or custom scripting.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: DynamoDB point-in-time recovery (PITR) provides continuous backups and allows you to restore your table to any point in time within the last 35 days. While excellent for recovering from recent accidental writes or deletes, PITR itself is not designed for long-term retention beyond 35 days. It does not meet the 7-year retention requirement on its own.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Creating on-demand backups via the DynamoDB console and then manually managing their storage in Amazon S3 (including setting S3 Lifecycle configurations) involves manual steps and is less operationally efficient than an automated and centralized solution like AWS Backup. While DynamoDB backups are stored in S3, AWS Backup provides the management layer for scheduling and retention across services.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Building a custom solution using Amazon EventBridge to trigger an AWS Lambda function for backing up the table and managing its lifecycle in S3 requires custom development, testing, and ongoing maintenance. This is significantly more operational effort compared to using the managed capabilities of AWS Backup, which is designed for these tasks.

  <summary>Question 79</summary>

A company is planning to use an Amazon DynamoDB table for data storage. The company is concerned about cost optimization. The table will not be used on most mornings. In the evenings, the read and write traffic will often be unpredictable. When traffic spikes occur, they will happen very quickly.

What should a solutions architect recommend?

- [ ] A. Create a DynamoDB table in on-demand capacity mode.
- [ ] B. Create a DynamoDB table with a global secondary index.
- [ ] C. Create a DynamoDB table with provisioned capacity and auto scaling.
- [ ] D. Create a DynamoDB table in provisioned capacity mode, and configure it as a global table.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] A. Create a DynamoDB table in on-demand capacity mode.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] DynamoDB On-Demand Capacity Mode: This capacity mode is specifically designed for workloads with unknown or unpredictable traffic patterns, and for applications where you want to pay only for what you use. DynamoDB on-demand automatically scales the read and write capacity to handle the traffic as it comes, without requiring manual capacity planning or adjustments.
- [ ] Handles Unpredictable and Spiky Traffic: The scenario describes traffic that is "often unpredictable" and where "traffic spikes occur, they will happen very quickly." On-demand mode excels in these situations by instantly accommodating the traffic up to previous peak levels (and then scaling further if needed), without throttling requests.
- [ ] Cost Optimization for Idle Periods: The table "will not be used on most mornings." With on-demand capacity mode, if there are no read or write requests to the table, you do not pay for any read/write throughput. This makes it very cost-effective for tables with significant idle periods.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option B is wrong because: A Global Secondary Index (GSI) is used to enable querying on attributes other than the table's primary key. While GSIs are an important feature for flexible data access, creating a GSI does not address the core requirements of managing unpredictable traffic patterns or optimizing costs related to read/write capacity.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: While DynamoDB provisioned capacity with auto scaling can adjust throughput, it might not react instantaneously to "very quickly" occurring traffic spikes. Auto scaling typically adjusts capacity based on consumed capacity over a period, and there can be a delay before capacity is scaled up, potentially leading to throttling during sudden, sharp spikes. Furthermore, with provisioned capacity, you pay for the capacity you provision, even if it's not fully utilized during the idle morning periods, making it less cost-effective than on-demand for this specific usage pattern.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: As explained for option C, provisioned capacity mode is less suitable for this workload pattern than on-demand mode.
DynamoDB global tables are designed for building multi-region, multi-active database solutions, typically for globally distributed applications or for disaster recovery across regions. The question does not mention any multi-region requirements. Configuring a global table adds complexity and cost that is not justified by the problem description.

  <summary>Question 80</summary>
  
A company recently signed a contract with an AWS Managed Service Provider (MSP) Partner for help with an application migration initiative. A solutions architect needs to share an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from an existing AWS account with the MSP Partner's AWS account. The AMI is backed by Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) and uses an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key to encrypt EBS volume snapshots.

What is the MOST secure way for the solutions architect to share the AMI with the MSP Partner's AWS account?

- [ ] A. Make the encrypted AMI and snapshots publicly available. Modify the key policy to allow the MSP Partner's AWS account to use the key.
- [ ] B. Modify the launchPermission property of the AMI. Share the AMI with the MSP Partner's AWS account only. Modify the key policy to allow the MSP Partner's AWS account to use the key.
- [ ] C. Modify the launchPermission property of the AMI. Share the AMI with the MSP Partner's AWS account only. Modify the key policy to trust a new KMS key that is owned by the MSP Partner for encryption.
- [ ] D. Export the AMI from the source account to an Amazon S3 bucket in the MSP Partner's AWS account, Encrypt the S3 bucket with a new KMS key that is owned by the MSP Partner. Copy and launch the AMI in the MSP Partner's AWS account.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] B. Modify the launchPermission property of the AMI. Share the AMI with the MSP Partner's AWS account only. Modify the key policy to allow the MSP Partner's AWS account to use the key.

Why this is the correct answer:

This solution follows the principle of least privilege and uses AWS-recommended mechanisms for sharing encrypted AMIs:

- [ ] Modify AMI Launch Permissions: To share a private AMI with another specific AWS account, you modify its launchPermission attribute. This allows you to specify the AWS account ID(s) that are permitted to launch instances from this AMI. Sharing it "with the MSP Partner's AWS account only" ensures that the AMI is not exposed to other unintended accounts.
- [ ] Share the KMS Key: Since the AMI's underlying EBS snapshots are encrypted with a customer-managed AWS KMS key, the MSP Partner's account will need permission to use this specific KMS key when launching an instance from the shared AMI (to decrypt the snapshots). This is achieved by modifying the key policy of the KMS key in the source account. The key policy must grant the MSP Partner's AWS account (or specific IAM principals within that account) the necessary permissions, such as kms:Decrypt, kms:ReEncrypt*, kms:CreateGrant, and kms:DescribeKey.
- [ ] MOST Secure Way: This method ensures that the AMI itself is not made public and that access to the encryption key is explicitly granted only to the trusted MSP partner account.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Making an AMI and its snapshots publicly available is a significant security risk, especially if they contain sensitive configurations or data. Even if the KMS key policy restricts usage, exposing the AMI publicly is not the "MOST secure way."
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: When the MSP partner launches an instance from the shared AMI, their account needs permission to use the original KMS key (owned by the source account) that was used to encrypt the snapshots. The source key policy grants usage permissions to the MSP account for the source key. It doesn't involve the source key policy "trusting a new KMS key owned by the MSP Partner for encryption" of the original snapshots. After launching, the MSP could choose to re-encrypt the resulting EBS volumes with their own key, but the initial launch requires access to the source key.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Exporting an AMI to S3 and then having the partner import it is a more cumbersome and less direct method than sharing the AMI via launch permissions. While it can be done, it involves more steps, data transfer, and potentially more complex permission management than the native AMI sharing mechanism. Direct AMI sharing combined with KMS key policy modification is generally considered more straightforward and secure for this use case.

# AWS-SAA-PRACTICE-EXAM Questions 81 - 90

  <summary>Question 81</summary>

A solutions architect is designing the cloud architecture for a new application being deployed on AWS. The process should run in parallel while adding and removing application nodes as needed based on the number of jobs to be processed. The processor application is stateless. The solutions architect must ensure that the application is loosely coupled and the job items are durably stored.

Which design should the solutions architect use?

- [ ] A. Create an Amazon SNS topic to send the jobs that need to be processed. Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that consists of the processor application. Create a launch configuration that uses the AMI. Create an Auto Scaling group using the launch configuration. Set the scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to add and remove nodes based on CPU usage.
- [ ] B. Create an Amazon SQS queue to hold the jobs that need to be processed. Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that consists of the processor application. Create a launch configuration that uses the AMI. Create an Auto Scaling group using the launch configuration. Set the scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to add and remove nodes based on network usage.
- [ ] C. Create an Amazon SQS queue to hold the jobs that need to be processed. Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that consists of the processor application. Create a launch template that uses the AMI. Create an Auto Scaling group using the launch template. Set the scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to add and remove nodes based on the number of items in the SQS queue.
- [ ] D. Create an Amazon SNS topic to send the jobs that need to be processed. Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that consists of the processor application. Create a launch template that uses the AMI. Create an Auto Scaling group using the launch template. Set the scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to add and remove nodes based on the number of messages published to the SNS topic.

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] C. Create an Amazon SQS queue to hold the jobs that need to be processed. Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that consists of the processor application. Create a launch template that uses the AMI. Create an Auto Scaling group using the launch template. Set the scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to add and remove nodes based on the number of items in the SQS queue.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Amazon SQS for Durable and Decoupled Job Queuing: Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is designed to store messages (job items) durably and provide loose coupling between components. This meets the requirements for job items to be "durably stored" and the application to be "loosely coupled."
- [ ] Stateless EC2 Instances with Auto Scaling: The processor application is stateless and can run on Amazon EC2 instances. An Auto Scaling group, using a launch template with the application's AMI, can manage these instances.
- [ ] Scaling Based on Queue Depth (Number of Jobs): The crucial requirement is to scale "based on the number of jobs to be processed." EC2 Auto Scaling can be configured to use Amazon CloudWatch metrics from SQS, such as ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible (the number of items in the SQS queue), to trigger scaling actions.
- [ ] This ensures that the number of application nodes (EC2 instances) scales up when there are many jobs in the queue and scales down when the queue is short. This allows processing to "run in parallel."
- [ ] Launch Templates: Launch templates are the recommended way to specify launch parameters for EC2 Auto Scaling groups, offering more features and flexibility than older launch configurations.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a publish/subscribe messaging service, primarily used for fanning out notifications to multiple subscribers. It is not designed as a queue for holding a backlog of jobs that need processing by a pool of workers in the way SQS is. Also, scaling based on CPU usage might not accurately reflect the number of pending jobs; jobs could be I/O-bound or numerous but individually lightweight on CPU.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: While using SQS is correct for job queuing, scaling the Auto Scaling group based on "network usage" is generally not a direct or reliable indicator of the number of jobs waiting to be processed. Scaling based on the SQS queue depth is a much more direct and appropriate metric.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: As with option A, SNS is not the appropriate service for durable job queuing. Furthermore, scaling based on the "number of messages published to the SNS topic" is not a standard or practical metric for an Auto Scaling group managing worker instances that process a backlog. SNS messages are pushed to subscribers and not typically stored in the topic itself for backlog processing.

  <summary>Question 82</summary>

A company hosts its web applications in the AWS Cloud. The company configures Elastic Load Balancers to use certificates that are imported into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). The company's security team must be notified 30 days before the expiration of each certificate.

What should a solutions architect recommend to meet this requirement?

- [ ] A. Add a rule in ACM to publish a custom message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic every day, beginning 30 days before any certificate will expire.
- [ ] B. Create an AWS Config rule that checks for certificates that will expire within 30 days. Configure Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) to invoke a custom alert by way of Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) when AWS Config reports a noncompliant resource.
- [ ] C. Use AWS Trusted Advisor to check for certificates that will expire within 30 days. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that is based on Trusted Advisor metrics for check status changes. Configure the alarm to send a custom alert by way of Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).
- [ ] D. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule to detect any certificates that will expire within 30 days. Configure the rule to invoke an AWS Lambda function. Configure the Lambda function to send a custom alert by way of Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] D. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule to detect any certificates that will expire within 30 days. Configure the rule to invoke an AWS Lambda function. Configure the Lambda function to send a custom alert by way of Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] ACM Events for Expiration: AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) automatically publishes events to Amazon EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events) when an imported certificate (which is the case here) is approaching its expiration date. Specifically, for certificates that ACM does not manage renewal for (like imported ones), an ACM Certificate Approaching Expiration event is sent at predefined intervals, including 30 days before expiration.
- [ ] EventBridge Rule: An EventBridge rule can be created to listen for this specific ACM Certificate Approaching Expiration event. The rule can be filtered to act only on the 30-day notification or process the event details to confirm the timeframe.
- [ ] Lambda for Custom Alerting: The EventBridge rule can be configured to invoke an AWS Lambda function. This Lambda function can then process the event details, format a custom notification message, and send this alert to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. The security team would be subscribed to this SNS topic to receive the notifications.
- [ ] Event-Driven and Serverless: This solution is event-driven, directly utilizing the notifications provided by ACM, and is fully serverless (EventBridge, Lambda, SNS), minimizing operational overhead.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) itself does not have a feature to "add a rule" to directly publish custom messages to SNS based on certificate expiration. ACM integrates with EventBridge for such event notifications.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: While AWS Config can be used with a managed rule (acm-certificate-expiration-check) to identify certificates nearing expiration and then trigger notifications via EventBridge and SNS, this approach adds an extra layer (AWS Config) primarily designed for broader configuration compliance and auditing. Directly reacting to ACM's native EventBridge events (as in option D) is a more direct and often simpler solution if the sole requirement is an expiration notification.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: AWS Trusted Advisor does provide a check for ACM certificate expiration. However, Trusted Advisor checks run periodically, and relying on its refresh cycle and then setting up CloudWatch alarms based on Trusted Advisor metrics can be less immediate or direct than using the real-time events emitted by ACM to EventBridge. Additionally, programmatic access to Trusted Advisor check results or automated notifications based on them might have dependencies on the company's AWS Support plan.

  <summary>Question 83</summary>

A company's dynamic website is hosted using on-premises servers in the United States. The company is launching its product in Europe, and it wants to optimize site loading times for new European users. The site's backend must remain in the United States. The product is being launched in a few days, and an immediate solution is needed.

What should the solutions architect recommend?

- [ ] A. Launch an Amazon EC2 instance in us-east-1 and migrate the site to it.
- [ ] B. Move the website to Amazon S3. Use Cross-Region Replication between Regions.
- [ ] C. Use Amazon CloudFront with a custom origin pointing to the on-premises servers.
- [ ] D. Use an Amazon Route 53 geoproximity routing policy pointing to on-premises servers.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] C. Use Amazon CloudFront with a custom origin pointing to the on-premises servers.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Amazon CloudFront for Latency Reduction: Amazon CloudFront is a global content delivery network (CDN) service. It caches static assets (like images, CSS, JavaScript) at edge locations around the world, including many in Europe. When European users access the website, these static assets can be served from a nearby edge location, significantly reducing latency and improving site loading times.
- [ ] Custom Origin for On-Premises Backend: CloudFront can be configured to use a "custom origin," which can be your on-premises servers located in the United States. For dynamic content that cannot be cached, CloudFront routes requests back to this origin, often over optimized network paths within the AWS backbone for part of the journey, which can still offer performance improvements compared to users directly accessing the US servers over the public internet.
- [ ] Backend Remains in the United States: This solution allows the site's backend to remain in the United States, as required.
- [ ] Immediate Solution: Setting up a CloudFront distribution with a custom origin is a relatively quick process and can provide immediate performance benefits for European users, meeting the "immediate solution is needed" requirement.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Migrating the site to an Amazon EC2 instance in us-east-1 (a US East region) still means the website is hosted in the United States. This would not fundamentally optimize site loading times for European users compared to well-provisioned on-premises US servers, especially if the backend must remain in the US anyway. CloudFront is specifically designed for global content delivery with low latency.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: Moving a "dynamic website" to Amazon S3 is only feasible if the dynamic aspects are handled elsewhere (e.g., via serverless functions) or if it can be converted to a static site. If the website truly relies on dynamic processing from the on-premises servers, S3 alone is not a suitable hosting solution for the dynamic parts. While S3 with Cross-Region Replication can distribute static assets, CloudFront is still the primary service for low-latency delivery of those assets.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: An Amazon Route 53 geoproximity routing policy (or geolocation routing) directs users to specific resources based on their geographic location. However, if all requests are ultimately pointed back to the same on-premises servers in the United States, this routing policy alone will not improve the loading times for European users. CloudFront improves performance by caching content closer to the users, which Route 53 by itself does not do.

A company wants to reduce the cost of its existing three-tier web architecture. The web, application, and database servers are running on Amazon EC2 instances for the development, test, and production environments. The EC2 instances average 30% CPU utilization during peak hours and 10% CPU utilization during non-peak hours. The production EC2 instances run 24 hours a day. The development and test EC2 instances run for at least 8 hours each day. The company plans to implement automation to stop the development and test EC2 instances when they are not in use.

Which EC2 instance purchasing solution will meet the company's requirements MOST cost-effectively?

- [ ] A. Use Spot Instances for the production EC2 instances. Use Reserved Instances for the development and test EC2 instances.
- [ ] B. Use Reserved Instances for the production EC2 instances. Use On-Demand Instances for the development and test EC2 instances.
- [ ] C. Use Spot blocks for the production EC2 instances. Use Reserved Instances for the development and test EC2 instances.
- [ ] D. Use On-Demand Instances for the production EC2 instances. Use Spot blocks for the development and test EC2 instances.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] B. Use Reserved Instances for the production EC2 instances. Use On-Demand Instances for the development and test EC2 instances.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Production EC2 Instances (24/7 workload): Reserved Instances (RIs): The production instances run 24 hours a day. For such continuous, predictable workloads, Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances offer significant discounts (up to 72%) compared to On-Demand pricing in exchange for a 1-year or 3-year commitment. This is the most cost-effective approach for the always-on production environment. Even with CPU utilization averaging 10-30%, having a baseline covered by RIs is beneficial.
- [ ] Development and Test EC2 Instances (Intermittent workload): On-Demand Instances: The development and test instances run for at least 8 hours a day and will be stopped when not in use. On-Demand Instances are ideal for such workloads because you pay for compute capacity by the second (for Linux) or hour with no long-term commitments or upfront payments. When the instances are stopped, you do not pay for the compute hours. This flexibility makes On-Demand cost-effective for these intermittent environments.
- [ ] MOST Cost-Effective Combination: This strategy optimizes costs by leveraging RIs for the predictable, continuous production load and On-Demand pricing for the flexible, stop-start nature of development and test environments.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because:
Spot Instances for Production: Spot Instances can offer deep discounts but can be interrupted by AWS with only a two-minute warning if AWS needs the capacity back. For production workloads of a three-tier web architecture, relying solely on Spot Instances is generally too risky due to potential service interruptions, unless the application is specifically designed for fault tolerance against such interruptions.
Reserved Instances for Dev/Test: Using RIs for development and test instances that are frequently stopped is not cost-effective. You commit to paying for RIs for the entire term, regardless of whether the instance is running or stopped (for most RI types).
- [ ] Option C is wrong because:
Spot Blocks for Production: Spot Instances with a defined duration (Spot blocks) are for workloads that need to run uninterrupted for a finite duration (1 to 6 hours). This is not suitable for production instances that run 24/7.
Reserved Instances for Dev/Test: Same issue as in option A.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because:
On-Demand Instances for Production: Using On-Demand Instances for production workloads that run 24/7 is the most expensive option. Significant savings can be achieved with RIs or Savings Plans for such continuous usage.
Spot Blocks for Dev/Test: While Spot (or Spot blocks if the "at least 8 hours" fits within the block duration and interruptions are acceptable) can be cheaper than On-Demand, the key is that On-Demand provides flexibility to stop and start without long-term commitment, making it suitable. However, the primary flaw in this option is using On-Demand for 24/7 production. Option B provides a better overall cost optimization strategy.

A company has a production web application in which users upload documents through a web interface or a mobile app. According to a new regulatory requirement. new documents cannot be modified or deleted after they are stored.

What should a solutions architect do to meet this requirement?

- [ ] A. Store the uploaded documents in an Amazon S3 bucket with S3 Versioning and S3 Object Lock enabled.
- [ ] B. Store the uploaded documents in an Amazon S3 bucket. Configure an S3 Lifecycle policy to archive the documents periodically.
- [ ] C. Store the uploaded documents in an Amazon S3 bucket with S3 Versioning enabled. Configure an ACL to restrict all access to read-only.
- [ ] D. Store the uploaded documents on an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) volume. Access the data by mounting the volume in read-only mode.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] A. Store the uploaded documents in an Amazon S3 bucket with S3 Versioning and S3 Object Lock enabled.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Amazon S3 for Document Storage: S3 is a highly durable and scalable service for storing documents.
- [ ] S3 Object Lock for Immutability: The core requirement is that documents "cannot be modified or deleted after they are stored." Amazon S3 Object Lock provides Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) protection for objects. When Object Lock is enabled with a retention period and mode (governance or compliance), it prevents objects from being overwritten or deleted for that specified duration.
- [ ] For the strictest requirement, compliance mode would be used, which prevents even the root user from deleting or overwriting the object version until the retention period expires.
- [ ] S3 Versioning Requirement: S3 Object Lock can only be enabled on buckets that have S3 Versioning enabled. Versioning itself helps protect against accidental overwrites (by creating new versions) and deletions (by creating delete markers), and Object Lock then protects specific object versions from being changed or deleted.
- [ ] This combination directly meets the regulatory requirement for immutability.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option B is wrong because: An S3 Lifecycle policy is used to manage the storage class of objects (e.g., moving them to archive tiers for cost savings) or to define when objects expire (are deleted). It does not prevent modification or deletion of active objects before the lifecycle rules apply. It's for managing data over its lifetime, not for making it immutable upon creation.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: While enabling S3 Versioning helps protect against accidental overwrites and allows recovery from deletions (by removing delete markers), it does not by itself prevent a user with delete permissions from deleting object versions. Configuring an ACL (or bucket policy) to restrict access to read-only would prevent modifications for users subject to that ACL/policy, but users with higher privileges could still potentially modify or delete objects or change the permissions. S3 Object Lock provides a stronger guarantee of immutability at the object level.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Mounting an Amazon EFS volume in read-only mode is a client-side setting. It does not prevent users or processes with write access to the EFS file system (e.g., from a different EC2 instance or with administrative privileges on the EFS mount) from modifying or deleting the files directly on the EFS file system. EFS does not have an equivalent to S3 Object Lock for file-level WORM protection.

- [ ] A. Store the database user credentials in AWS Secrets Manager. Grant the necessary IAM permissions to allow the web servers to access AWS Secrets Manager.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] AWS Secrets Manager for Secure Storage and Rotation: AWS Secrets Manager is a service specifically designed to manage, retrieve, and rotate secrets such as database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information. It securely stores the credentials and integrates with services like Amazon RDS MySQL to enable automatic credential rotation on a schedule. This directly meets the requirement to "rotate user credentials frequently" with minimal operational overhead.
- [ ] Secure Access for Applications: Web servers (running on EC2 instances or containers) can be granted IAM permissions (typically via an IAM role attached to the compute resource) to securely retrieve the database credentials from Secrets Manager at runtime. This avoids hardcoding credentials in application code or configuration files.
- [ ] Centralized Management: Secrets Manager provides a central place to manage and audit access to secrets.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option B is wrong because: AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter is a service used for aggregating, investigating, and resolving operational issues (OpsItems) related to your AWS resources. It is not designed or intended for storing or managing sensitive data like database credentials.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: While storing credentials in an encrypted S3 bucket is possible, it is generally less secure and less manageable than using a dedicated secrets management service like AWS Secrets Manager. More importantly, this approach does not provide an automated mechanism for frequent credential rotation; this would have to be custom-built, increasing operational overhead.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Storing encrypted credential files directly on the web server's file system still poses risks if the server is compromised. Managing the encryption keys, the decryption process within the application, and especially the frequent rotation of these credentials across multiple web servers would be operationally complex and error-prone. AWS Secrets Manager centralizes and automates these tasks.

  <summary>Question 87</summary>

A company hosts an application on AWS Lambda functions that are invoked by an Amazon API Gateway API. The Lambda functions save customer data to an Amazon Aurora MySQL database. Whenever the company upgrades the database, the Lambda functions fail to establish database connections until the upgrade is complete. The result is that customer data is not recorded for some of the event.

A solutions architect needs to design a solution that stores customer data that is created during database upgrades.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Provision an Amazon RDS proxy to sit between the Lambda functions and the database. Configure the Lambda functions to connect to the RDS proxy.
- [ ] B. Increase the run time of the Lambda functions to the maximum. Create a retry mechanism in the code that stores the customer data in the database.
- [ ] C. Persist the customer data to Lambda local storage. Configure new Lambda functions to scan the local storage to save the customer data to the database.
- [ ] D. Store the customer data in an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue. Create a new Lambda function that polls the queue and stores the customer data in the database.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] D. Store the customer data in an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue. Create a new Lambda function that polls the queue and stores the customer data in the database.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Decoupling with Amazon SQS: The primary issue is data loss when the database is unavailable during upgrades. By introducing an Amazon SQS queue, the Lambda functions invoked by API Gateway can send the customer data as messages to the SQS queue instead of trying to write directly to the database. SQS acts as a durable buffer.
- [ ] Ensuring Data Durability: Messages sent to SQS are stored durably until they are successfully processed. This means if the database is down for an upgrade, the incoming customer data is not lost but is queued safely.
- [ ] Asynchronous Processing by a Second Lambda: A separate AWS Lambda function can be configured to poll the SQS queue. This second Lambda function would be responsible for reading messages from the queue and writing the customer data to the Amazon Aurora MySQL database. This processing happens asynchronously. If the database is unavailable, the messages remain in the SQS queue, and the Lambda function can retry processing them later (SQS allows messages to become visible again after a timeout if not deleted).
- [ ] FIFO Queue for Order Preservation: Using an SQS FIFO (First-In, First-Out) queue ensures that customer data is processed and stored in the database in the same order it was received, which can be important for transactional data.
- [ ] This solution directly addresses the problem by ensuring data created during database upgrades is durably stored and processed once the database is available.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: While Amazon RDS Proxy is excellent for managing database connections (pooling) and improving application resilience to database failovers (e.g., in a Multi-AZ setup), it doesn't inherently solve the problem of the database being completely unavailable for an extended period during an upgrade. If the RDS Proxy cannot connect to the underlying database because it's undergoing an upgrade, the Lambda functions would still fail to save data through the proxy. RDS Proxy doesn't queue the data itself if the database is offline.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: Increasing Lambda run time and implementing retries within the Lambda code might help with very short, transient database unavailability. However, database upgrades can sometimes take several minutes or longer, potentially exceeding even the maximum Lambda execution time (15 minutes). Continuous retries during an extended upgrade would be inefficient, costly, and could still result in data loss if all retries fail or the Lambda times out. It doesn't provide a durable store for data arriving during the entire upgrade window.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Lambda local storage (/tmp directory) is ephemeral and non-persistent. It is tied to a specific execution environment of a Lambda invocation and is not suitable for durably storing customer data, especially if the Lambda function fails or new invocations are used for subsequent requests. Data stored there would be lost.

  <summary>Question 88</summary>

A survey company has gathered data for several years from areas in the United States. The company hosts the data in an Amazon S3 bucket that is 3 TB in size and growing. The company has started to share the data with a European marketing firm that has S3 buckets. The company wants to ensure that its data transfer costs remain as low as possible.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Configure the Requester Pays feature on the company's S3 bucket.
- [ ] B. Configure S3 Cross-Region Replication from the company's S3 bucket to one of the marketing firm's S3 buckets.
- [ ] C. Configure cross-account access for the marketing firm so that the marketing firm has access to the company's S3 bucket.
- [ ] D. Configure the company's S3 bucket to use S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Sync the S3 bucket to one of the marketing firm's S3 buckets.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] A. Configure the Requester Pays feature on the company's S3 bucket.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] S3 Requester Pays Feature: The Amazon S3 Requester Pays feature allows the bucket owner to specify that the requester (the party downloading the data) will pay for the data transfer out costs, instead of the bucket owner.
- [ ] Minimizing the Survey Company's Costs: By enabling Requester Pays on their S3 bucket, the survey company ensures that when the European marketing firm accesses and downloads the data, the marketing firm incurs the associated data transfer costs. This directly meets the requirement for the survey company to keep "its data transfer costs remain as low as possible."
- [ ] Data Sharing: This solution still allows the marketing firm to access the necessary data from the survey company's S3 bucket, provided they are authenticated and authorized, and are willing to accept the data transfer charges.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option B is wrong because: If the survey company configures S3 Cross-Region Replication to replicate data to the marketing firm's S3 bucket (presumably in a European region), the survey company (as the owner of the source bucket and the replication configuration) would be responsible for the inter-region data transfer costs associated with the replication itself. This would likely increase the survey company's data transfer costs, not minimize them.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Configuring cross-account access allows the marketing firm to access the data in the survey company's S3 bucket. However, unless Requester Pays is also enabled, the survey company (as the bucket owner) would typically still be billed for the data transfer out costs when the marketing firm downloads the data from their bucket. This does not inherently minimize the survey company's data transfer costs.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: S3 Intelligent-Tiering is a storage class that optimizes storage costs by automatically moving data between access tiers based on usage patterns. It does not directly affect or reduce data transfer costs. Syncing the S3 bucket to the marketing firm's bucket would involve data transfer, and the costs for this transfer would likely be borne by the survey company if they initiate the sync, similar to replication.

  <summary>Question 89</summary>

A company uses Amazon S3 to store its confidential audit documents. The S3 bucket uses bucket policies to restrict access to audit team IAM user credentials according to the principle of least privilege. Company managers are worried about accidental deletion of documents in the S3 bucket and want a more secure solution.

What should a solutions architect do to secure the audit documents?

- [ ] A. Enable the versioning and MFA Delete features on the S3 bucket.
- [ ] B. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on the IAM user credentials for each audit team IAM user account.
- [ ] C. Add an S3 Lifecycle policy to the audit team's IAM user accounts to deny the s3:DeleteObject action during audit dates.
- [ ] D. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt the S3 bucket and restrict audit team IAM user accounts from accessing the KMS key.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] A. Enable the versioning and MFA Delete features on the S3 bucket.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] S3 Versioning for Recovery: Enabling S3 Versioning on the bucket means that multiple versions of each document (object) are preserved. If a document is "deleted," S3 actually inserts a delete marker instead of permanently removing the object's content. This allows for easy recovery from accidental deletions by simply removing the delete marker or restoring a previous version. This directly addresses the concern about "accidental deletion."
- [ ] MFA Delete for Enhanced Deletion Protection: Enabling MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) Delete on a versioning-enabled bucket adds another layer of security. For certain operations, such as permanently deleting an object version or changing the versioning state of the bucket, the bucket owner must provide their standard AWS credentials plus a valid code from their MFA device. This makes it significantly harder to accidentally (or even maliciously, without MFA device access) permanently delete documents. This provides a "more secure solution."

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option B is wrong because: Enabling MFA for IAM user accounts is a good security practice for protecting user identities and preventing unauthorized access to those accounts. However, it does not directly prevent an authorized user (who has successfully authenticated with MFA) from accidentally deleting a document if their IAM permissions allow deletion. MFA Delete on the S3 bucket (Option A) specifically protects the S3 delete operations themselves.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: S3 Lifecycle policies are used to manage the lifecycle of objects (e.g., transitioning them to different storage classes or expiring/deleting them after a defined period). You cannot attach S3 Lifecycle policies to IAM user accounts. While a bucket policy could be used to deny delete actions, this option misrepresents how lifecycle policies function and what they are applied to.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Using AWS KMS to encrypt the S3 bucket is essential for protecting the confidentiality of the audit documents (data at rest). However, encryption does not prevent the documents from being deleted. If an authorized user (or an attacker who gains access) deletes an encrypted document, the document is still gone. The primary concern stated is "accidental deletion," not unauthorized reading of the content.

  <summary>Question 90</summary>

A company is using a SQL database to store movie data that is publicly accessible. The database runs on an Amazon RDS Single-AZ DB instance. A script runs queries at random intervals each day to record the number of new movies that have been added to the database. The script must report a final total during business hours.

The company's development team notices that the database performance is inadequate for development tasks when the script is running. A solutions architect must recommend a solution to resolve this issue.

Which solution will meet this requirement with the LEAST operational overhead?

- [ ] A. Modify the DB instance to be a Multi-AZ deployment.
- [ ] B. Create a read replica of the database. Configure the script to query only the read replica.
- [ ] C. Instruct the development team to manually export the entries in the database at the end of each day.
- [ ] D. Use Amazon ElastiCache to cache the common queries that the script runs against the database.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] B. Create a read replica of the database. Configure the script to query only the read replica.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Issue: Read Load Impacting Primary DB: The problem states that the script's queries (which are read operations to count new movies) are degrading database performance for development tasks. This indicates that the read load from the script is impacting the primary (and only) DB instance.
- [ ] Amazon RDS Read Replicas: Amazon RDS allows you to create one or more read replicas of your source DB instance. Read replicas are asynchronously replicated copies of the primary instance and are designed to offload read-heavy traffic.
- [ ] Offloading Script Queries: By creating a read replica and modifying the script to direct its queries to this read replica, the read load generated by the script is removed from the primary DB instance. This allows the primary instance to dedicate its resources to serving the development team's tasks and other application writes without performance degradation caused by the script.
- [ ] Least Operational Overhead: Creating a read replica in RDS is a managed operation. Modifying the script's connection string to point to the read replica's endpoint is a relatively small change. This solution effectively isolates the read traffic with minimal ongoing management effort.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Modifying the DB instance to a Multi-AZ deployment creates a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone. The primary purpose of Multi-AZ is to provide high availability and data durability by enabling automatic failover. The standby instance in a Multi-AZ setup does not serve read traffic (except during a failover event). Therefore, this will not alleviate the performance issue caused by the script's read queries on the primary instance.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Instructing the development team to perform manual exports is an operational burden and does not solve the problem of the script itself impacting database performance when it runs. The script still needs to run its queries to get the count of new movies.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Amazon ElastiCache is an in-memory caching service. While it can reduce database load by caching frequently accessed query results, the script is querying for "new movies added." Such queries, which seek new or changing data, are often not good candidates for caching, as the cache would frequently be stale or miss the latest additions. A read replica directly offloads the entire query load, regardless of whether the results are cacheable.

A company has applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances in a VPC. One of the applications needs to call the Amazon S3 API to store and read objects. According to the company's security regulations, no traffic from the applications is allowed to travel across the internet.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

- [ ] A. Configure an S3 gateway endpoint.
- [ ] B. Create an S3 bucket in a private subnet.
- [ ] C. Create an S3 bucket in the same AWS Region as the EC2 instances.
- [ ] D. Configure a NAT gateway in the same subnet as the EC2 instances.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] A. Configure an S3 gateway endpoint.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] S3 Gateway Endpoint for Private Connectivity: An Amazon S3 gateway endpoint (a type of VPC endpoint) enables your EC2 instances within a VPC to connect to Amazon S3 services directly, without requiring traffic to traverse an Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection.
- [ ] No Internet Traffic: Traffic between your VPC and Amazon S3 using a gateway endpoint stays entirely within the AWS network. This ensures that "no traffic from the applications is allowed to travel across the internet," meeting the company's security regulation.
- [ ] Cost and Performance: Using a gateway endpoint for S3 can also reduce data transfer costs, as data transferred to S3 within the same region via a gateway endpoint is typically free, and it avoids NAT gateway processing charges. It can also improve performance due to the direct private connection.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option B is wrong because: Amazon S3 buckets are not created "in a private subnet." S3 is a regional service, and buckets are accessed via regional or global endpoints. The concept of placing an S3 bucket within a VPC subnet is incorrect.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: While creating an S3 bucket in the same AWS Region as the EC2 instances is a general best practice for performance and cost, it does not, by itself, ensure that traffic between the EC2 instances and S3 will not traverse the internet (e.g., if the instances are in a private subnet and use a NAT gateway to reach public S3 endpoints). The security regulation specifically requires traffic not to travel across the internet.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: A NAT gateway is used to allow instances in a private subnet to initiate outbound connections to the internet or other AWS public services (like S3 public endpoints) while preventing unsolicited inbound connections from the internet. If EC2 instances use a NAT gateway to access S3, the traffic is routed through the NAT gateway to S3's public endpoints. While this traffic typically stays within the AWS network for same-region S3 access, a gateway endpoint (Option A) provides a more direct, private path within the VPC without relying on NAT gateways and ensures traffic doesn't use public S3 endpoints via the internet path. The requirement is explicitly "no traffic... across the internet."

A company is storing sensitive user information in an Amazon S3 bucket. The company wants to provide secure access to this bucket from the application tier running on Amazon EC2 instances inside a VPC.

Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to accomplish this? (Choose two.)

- [ ] A. Configure a VPC gateway endpoint for Amazon S3 within the VPC.
- [ ] B. Create a bucket policy to make the objects in the S3 bucket public.
- [ ] C. Create a bucket policy that limits access to only the application tier running in the VPC.
- [ ] D. Create an IAM user with an S3 access policy and copy the IAM credentials to the EC2 instance.
- [ ] E. Create a NAT instance and have the EC2 instances use the NAT instance to access the S3 bucket.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] A. Configure a VPC gateway endpoint for Amazon S3 within the VPC.
- [ ] C. Create a bucket policy that limits access to only the application tier running in the VPC.

Why these are the correct answers:

This question focuses on providing secure access from EC2 instances within a VPC to an S3 bucket containing sensitive information.

A. Configure a VPC gateway endpoint for Amazon S3 within the VPC.
- [ ] Private Connectivity: A VPC gateway endpoint for S3 allows your EC2 instances within the VPC to communicate with S3 without traffic leaving the AWS network (i.e., not going over the public internet via an Internet Gateway or NAT Gateway). This enhances security by keeping the network path private.
- [ ] Cost Savings: It can also reduce data transfer costs as traffic to S3 via a gateway endpoint within the same region does not incur data transfer charges or NAT gateway processing fees.

C. Create a bucket policy that limits access to only the application tier running in the VPC.
- [ ] Principle of Least Privilege: An S3 bucket policy allows you to define fine-grained permissions on your S3 bucket and its objects. To secure sensitive data, you should create a bucket policy that explicitly grants access only to the necessary principals. In this case, it would be the IAM role(s) associated with the EC2 instances in the application tier.
- [ ] Restricting Access: The policy can be written to allow actions (like s3:GetObject, s3:PutObject) only if the request originates from the EC2 instances belonging to the application tier (e.g., by referencing their IAM role or the VPC endpoint). This ensures that only the authorized application tier can access the sensitive information.
- [ ] Combining a private network path (VPC gateway endpoint) with resource-based permissions (S3 bucket policy) provides a robust and secure access mechanism.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option B is wrong because: Making an S3 bucket that stores "sensitive user information" public is a severe security risk and directly contradicts the goal of providing secure access.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Creating an IAM user and embedding its long-term access keys (access key ID and secret access key) onto EC2 instances is not a security best practice. These credentials can be compromised if the instance is breached. The recommended approach for EC2 instances to securely access AWS services is by using IAM roles, which provide temporary, automatically rotated credentials.
- [ ] Option E is wrong because: A NAT instance (or NAT Gateway) is used to enable instances in a private subnet to initiate outbound connections to the internet or public AWS services. While this allows access to S3's public endpoints, it does not provide the same level of private connectivity as a VPC gateway endpoint. Using a VPC gateway endpoint is more secure for this use case as it keeps traffic off the internet path and can also be more cost-effective.

  <summary>Question 93</summary>

A company runs an on-premises application that is powered by a MySQL database. The company is migrating the application to AWS to increase the application's elasticity and availability. The current architecture shows heavy read activity on the database during times of normal operation. Every 4 hours, the company's development team pulls a full export of the production database to populate a database in the staging environment. During this period, users experience unacceptable application latency. The development team is unable to use the staging environment until the procedure completes.

A solutions architect must recommend replacement architecture that alleviates the application latency issue. The replacement architecture also must give the development team the ability to continue using the staging environment without delay.

Which solution meets these requirements?

- [ ] A. Use Amazon Aurora MySQL with Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas for production. Populate the staging database by implementing a backup and restore process that uses the mysqldump utility.
- [ ] B. Use Amazon Aurora MySQL with Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas for production. Use database cloning to create the staging database on-demand.
- [ ] C. Use Amazon RDS for MySQL with a Multi-AZ deployment and read replicas for production. Use the standby instance for the staging database.
- [ ] D. Use Amazon RDS for MySQL with a Multi-AZ deployment and read replicas for production. Populate the staging database by implementing a backup and restore process that uses the mysqldump utility.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] B. Use Amazon Aurora MySQL with Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas for production. Use database cloning to create the staging database on-demand.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Amazon Aurora MySQL for Production: Amazon Aurora MySQL is a high-performance, MySQL-compatible database designed for the cloud. Using it with Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas addresses the "heavy read activity" by allowing read traffic to be offloaded to the replicas, and provides high availability for the production environment.
- [ ] Database Cloning for Staging: A key feature of Amazon Aurora is its ability to perform fast database cloning. Cloning creates a new, independent copy of your database cluster very quickly (often in minutes), regardless of the database size. This is because it's initially a copy-on-write clone. This process has minimal impact on the performance of the production database.
- [ ] Alleviates Latency and Staging Delay: By using database cloning instead of a full export (like mysqldump), the "unacceptable application latency" experienced on the production database during the export process is eliminated. The staging database can be created quickly "on-demand," allowing the development team to use the staging environment "without delay."

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Implementing a backup and restore process using the mysqldump utility to populate the staging database is similar to the current problematic method of pulling a full export. This would likely still impose a significant load on the production database and take considerable time, leading to the same latency issues and delays for the staging environment that the company wants to avoid.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: In an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployment, the standby instance is a passive replica maintained for failover purposes. It cannot be directly accessed or used to serve read traffic or as a source for a staging database. Attempting to use the standby instance for staging is not a supported or viable approach. Read replicas are used for offloading read traffic, not the standby.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Similar to option A, using mysqldump for backup and restore to populate the staging database does not solve the core problem of performance degradation on the production instance during the export or the time it takes to make the staging environment available. While Amazon RDS for MySQL with read replicas is a good solution for read-heavy production workloads, the method for creating the staging environment is flawed in this option.

  <summary>Question 94</summary>

- [ ] A.  Turn  
A company is designing an application where users upload small files into Amazon S3. After a user uploads a file, the file requires one-time simple processing to transform the data and save the data in JSON format for later analysis. Each file must be processed as quickly as possible after it is uploaded. Demand will vary. On some days, users will upload a high number of files. On other days, users will upload a few files or no files.

Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- [ ] A. Configure Amazon EMR to read text files from Amazon S3. Run processing scripts to transform the data. Store the resulting JSON file in an Amazon Aurora DB cluster.
- [ ] B. Configure Amazon S3 to send an event notification to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Use Amazon EC2 instances to read from the queue and process the data. Store the resulting JSON file in Amazon DynamoDB.
- [ ] C. Configure Amazon S3 to send an event notification to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Use an AWS Lambda function to read from the queue and process the data. Store the resulting JSON file in Amazon DynamoDB.
- [ ] D. Configure Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) to send an event to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams when a new file is uploaded. Use an AWS Lambda function to consume the event from the stream and process the data. Store the resulting JSON file in an Amazon Aurora DB cluster.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] C. Configure Amazon S3 to send an event notification to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Use an AWS Lambda function to read from the queue and process the data. Store the resulting JSON file in Amazon DynamoDB.

Why this is the correct answer:

This solution offers a serverless, event-driven architecture that is efficient and has low operational overhead:

- [ ] Amazon S3 for File Uploads: S3 is the ideal place to store the uploaded small files.
- [ ] S3 Event Notification to SQS: When a new file is uploaded to S3, an S3 event notification can automatically send a message (containing details about the uploaded file) to an Amazon SQS queue. SQS decouples the file upload from the processing step and provides a durable buffer, which is excellent for handling varying demand ("high number of files" or "few files").
- [ ] AWS Lambda for Processing: An AWS Lambda function can be configured to use the SQS queue as an event source. Lambda will automatically poll the queue and invoke the function to process each file. Since the processing is "one-time simple processing," Lambda is well-suited. It scales automatically based on the number of messages in the queue, ensuring files are processed "as quickly as possible." As a serverless service, it minimizes operational overhead.
- [ ] Amazon DynamoDB for JSON Storage: After processing, the transformed data (in JSON format) can be stored in Amazon DynamoDB. DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database that is excellent for storing JSON documents and scales seamlessly, suitable for "later analysis."
- [ ] Least Operational Overhead: This entire pipeline (S3 -> SQS -> Lambda -> DynamoDB) consists of managed and serverless services, requiring minimal infrastructure management from the company.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Amazon EMR is a big data platform designed for large-scale distributed data processing using frameworks like Spark and Hadoop. Using EMR for "one-time simple processing" of "small files" is overly complex, not cost-effective for this scale, and incurs significant operational overhead compared to Lambda. Storing simple JSON results in an Amazon Aurora DB cluster might also be more overhead than DynamoDB if the analysis needs don't strictly require a relational database.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: While using S3 event notifications to SQS is a good start, using Amazon EC2 instances to read from the queue and process data requires managing those instances (provisioning, patching, scaling). AWS Lambda (as in option C) offers a serverless alternative that eliminates this instance management overhead and scales automatically.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Using Amazon EventBridge to send an event to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for individual small file uploads adds an unnecessary layer of complexity. Kinesis Data Streams is designed for continuous, real-time data streaming, not typically for discrete file processing events initiated by S3 uploads in this manner. A direct S3 event to SQS (or even S3 to Lambda directly for very quick tasks) is simpler. Also, as with option A, Aurora might be more overhead than DynamoDB for storing the resulting JSON for analysis.

  <summary>Question 95</summary>
 
An application allows users at a company's headquarters to access product data. The product data is stored in an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance. The operations team has isolated an application performance slowdown and wants to separate read traffic from write traffic. A solutions architect needs to optimize the application's performance quickly.

What should the solutions architect recommend?

- [ ] A. Change the existing database to a Multi-AZ deployment. Serve the read requests from the primary Availability Zone.
- [ ] B. Change the existing database to a Multi-AZ deployment. Serve the read requests from the secondary Availability Zone.
- [ ] C. Create read replicas for the database. Configure the read replicas with half of the compute and storage resources as the source database.
- [ ] D. Create read replicas for the database. Configure the read replicas with the same compute and storage resources as the source database.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] D. Create read replicas for the database. Configure the read replicas with the same compute and storage resources as the source database.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Separating Read and Write Traffic: The core problem is an application performance slowdown, and the desired solution is to "separate read traffic from write traffic." Amazon RDS Read Replicas are specifically designed for this purpose. They are asynchronously replicated copies of the primary database instance that can offload read-intensive workloads.
- [ ] Optimizing Performance Quickly: Creating one or more read replicas for an existing RDS instance is a relatively quick and standard procedure. Once created, the application can be configured to direct its read queries to the read replica endpoint(s) and write queries to the primary instance endpoint. This immediately reduces the load on the primary instance, improving its performance for write operations and overall application responsiveness.
- [ ] Sizing of Read Replicas: To effectively handle the read traffic that was previously causing slowdowns on the primary, the read replicas should have adequate resources. Configuring them with the "same compute and storage resources as the source database" (or resources appropriately sized for the read workload) ensures they can handle the diverted read traffic without becoming a new bottleneck. Under-provisioning read replicas could lead to poor read performance.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: A Multi-AZ deployment for Amazon RDS provides high availability and data durability by creating a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone. However, this standby replica does not serve read traffic during normal operations (it only becomes active during a failover). All read and write traffic still goes to the primary instance. Thus, this does not separate read traffic or alleviate read-related performance issues on the primary.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: Similar to option A, the secondary (standby) instance in a Multi-AZ deployment is not used for serving read traffic during normal operations. It is strictly for failover. Attempting to serve read requests from the secondary Availability Zone in a standard Multi-AZ setup is incorrect.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: While creating read replicas is the correct approach, configuring them with "half of the compute and storage resources as the source database" might not be sufficient to handle the existing read load effectively, especially if that read load is significant enough to cause a performance slowdown on the primary. If the read replicas are under-provisioned, they could simply become a new performance bottleneck for read queries, failing to optimize overall application performance.

  <summary>Question 96</summary>

An Amazon EC2 administrator created the following policy associated with an IAM group containing several users:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:TerminateInstances",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "IpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": "10.100.100.0/24"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "ec2:*",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringNotEquals": {
          "ec2:Region": "us-east-1"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

What is the effect of this policy?

- [ ] A. Users can terminate an EC2 instance in any AWS Region except us-east-1.
- [ ] B. Users can terminate an EC2 instance with the IP address 10.100.100.1 in the us-east-1 Region.
- [ ] C. Users can terminate an EC2 instance in the us-east-1 Region when the user's source IP is 10.100.100.254.
- [ ] D. Users cannot terminate an EC2 instance in the us-east-1 Region when the user's source IP is 10.100.100.254.

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] C. Users can terminate an EC2 instance in the us-east-1 Region when the user's source IP is 10.100.100.254.

Why this is the correct answer:

Let's break down the IAM policy:

- [ ] First Statement (Allow TerminateInstances):

"Effect": "Allow"
"Action": "ec2:TerminateInstances"
"Resource": "*" (applies to all EC2 instances)
"Condition": {"IpAddress": {"aws:SourceIp": "10.100.100.0/24"}} This statement allows users to terminate EC2 instances only if their request originates from an IP address within the 10.100.100.0/24 range (i.e., 10.100.100.0 to 10.100.100.255).
Second Statement (Deny EC2 actions outside us-east-1):

"Effect": "Deny"
"Action": "ec2:*" (applies to all EC2 actions)
"Resource": "*" (applies to all EC2 resources)
"Condition": {"StringNotEquals": {"ec2:Region": "us-east-1"}} This statement denies all EC2 actions if the action is performed in any region other than us-east-1. If the region is us-east-1, the StringNotEquals condition is false, and this Deny statement does not take effect. If the region is, for example, eu-west-1, the condition is true, and the action is denied.

Combined Effect:

- [ ] An explicit Deny in an IAM policy always overrides an Allow.
- [ ] Because of the second statement, users can only perform any EC2 actions (including ec2:TerminateInstances) if those actions are targeted at resources within the us-east-1 Region. All EC2 actions in other regions are denied.
- [ ] For the ec2:TerminateInstances action to be allowed (it must be in us-east-1 due to the second statement), the condition in the first statement must also be met: the user's source IP address must be within the 10.100.100.0/24 range.
- [ ] Evaluating Option C: "Users can terminate an EC2 instance in the us-east-1 Region when the user's source IP is 10.100.100.254."
- [ ] Region Check: The action is in us-east-1. The second statement's Deny condition (StringNotEquals: {"ec2:Region": "us-east-1"}) is false, so the Deny does not apply.
- [ ] Source IP Check: The user's source IP is 10.100.100.254. This IP address is within the 10.100.100.0/24 range specified in the first statement's Allow condition.
- [ ] Conclusion: Both conditions for the Allow are met, and the overriding Deny (for other regions) does not apply. Therefore, users can terminate instances in us-east-1 if their IP is 10.100.100.254.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: The second statement explicitly denies all EC2 actions in any region except us-east-1. Therefore, users cannot terminate instances outside of us-east-1.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: The Allow condition in the first statement is based on the user's source IP address (aws:SourceIp), not the IP address of the EC2 instance being terminated. The IP address 10.100.100.1 refers to an instance's potential IP, which is not what the policy conditions on for allowing the action.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: This directly contradicts the correct analysis of option C. If the conditions in option C are met (action in us-east-1 and source IP is 10.100.100.254), the termination is allowed.

  <summary>Question 97</summary>

A company has a large Microsoft SharePoint deployment running on-premises that requires Microsoft Windows shared file storage. The company wants to migrate this workload to the AWS Cloud and is considering various storage options. The storage solution must be highly available and integrated with Active Directory for access control.

Which solution will satisfy these requirements?

- [ ] A. Configure Amazon EFS storage and set the Active Directory domain for authentication.
- [ ] B. Create an SMB file share on an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway in two Availability Zones.
- [ ] C. Create an Amazon S3 bucket and configure Microsoft Windows Server to mount it as a volume.
- [ ] D. Create an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system on AWS and set the Active Directory domain for authentication.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] D. Create an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system on AWS and set the Active Directory domain for authentication.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Amazon FSx for Windows File Server: This service is specifically designed to provide fully managed, native Microsoft Windows file systems. It supports the SMB (Server Message Block) protocol, Windows NTFS permissions, and Active Directory (AD) integration, which are all critical requirements for a Microsoft SharePoint deployment.
- [ ] Active Directory Integration: FSx for Windows File Server can be joined to your existing Microsoft Active Directory domain (either AWS Managed Microsoft AD or your self-managed AD on-premises or in AWS). This allows you to use your existing AD users, groups, and permissions for access control to the file shares, meeting the requirement for AD integration.
- [ ] High Availability: FSx for Windows File Server supports Multi-AZ deployments, which provide high availability and durability by automatically replicating data across multiple Availability Zones and handling failover. This meets the "highly available" requirement.
- [ ] Suitable for SharePoint: SharePoint heavily relies on Windows shared file storage with specific features and performance characteristics that FSx for Windows File Server is built to provide.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) provides file storage primarily using the NFS (Network File System) protocol. While Windows clients can connect to NFS shares, SharePoint typically requires and is optimized for SMB/CIFS file shares with native Windows NTFS permissions and deep Active Directory integration. FSx for Windows File Server is the more appropriate AWS service for this. EFS does not offer the same level of native Windows compatibility and AD integration for NTFS ACLs.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: An AWS Storage Gateway file gateway can provide an SMB interface, typically with Amazon S3 as the backend storage. While it can integrate with Active Directory, using it as the primary storage solution for a SharePoint deployment being migrated to AWS might not offer the same performance or full feature set as a native Windows file system like FSx for Windows File Server. FSx provides a fully managed Windows Server-based file system directly in the cloud. Deploying a file gateway "in two Availability Zones" refers to the on-premises gateway instances for HA, not typically how the cloud storage itself is made HA for this use case.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Amazon S3 is an object storage service. While there are ways (often involving third-party tools or specific configurations like AWS File Gateway) to present S3 storage as a mountable volume to Windows Server, S3 does not natively provide the file system semantics (like file locking, hierarchical directory structures with NTFS permissions) or the performance characteristics required by demanding applications like SharePoint for its core content databases and file storage. This is not a recommended or robust solution for SharePoint's shared file storage needs.

  <summary>Question 98</summary>

An image-processing company has a web application that users use to upload images. The application uploads the images into an Amazon S3 bucket. The company has set up S3 event notifications to publish the object creation events to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue. The SQS queue serves as the event source for an AWS Lambda function that processes the images and sends the results to users through email.

Users report that they are receiving multiple email messages for every uploaded image. A solutions architect determines that SQS messages are invoking the Lambda function more than once, resulting in multiple email messages.

What should the solutions architect do to resolve this issue with the LEAST operational overhead?

- [ ] A. Set up long polling in the SQS queue by increasing the ReceiveMessage wait time to 30 seconds.
- [ ] B. Change the SQS standard queue to an SQS FIFO queue. Use the message deduplication ID to discard duplicate messages.
- [ ] C. Increase the visibility timeout in the SQS queue to a value that is greater than the total of the function timeout and the batch window timeout.
- [ ] D. Modify the Lambda function to delete each message from the SQS queue immediately after the message is read before processing.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] C. Increase the visibility timeout in the SQS queue to a value that is greater than the total of the function timeout and the batch window timeout.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Understanding SQS Visibility Timeout: When an AWS Lambda function (or any consumer) retrieves a message from an SQS queue, the message is not immediately deleted.
- [ ] Instead, it becomes temporarily invisible to other consumers for a configurable period called the "visibility timeout." The Lambda function is expected to process the message and then explicitly delete it from the queue within this timeout period.
- [ ] Cause of Multiple Invocations: If the Lambda function takes longer to process the image and send the email than the current visibility timeout allows, or if it fails during processing and doesn't delete the message, the message will become visible again in the SQS queue after the timeout expires.
- [ ] Another Lambda invocation (or a retry of the same function if configured) will then pick up the same message, leading to it being processed again and a duplicate email being sent.
- [ ] Solution with Visibility Timeout: Increasing the visibility timeout to a value that is comfortably longer than the maximum time the Lambda function needs to successfully process a message (including image processing, sending email, and deleting the message from SQS) will prevent the message from becoming visible again prematurely. This gives a single Lambda invocation enough time to complete its work, ensuring the message is processed only once. This is often the simplest fix with the "LEAST operational overhead" for this specific problem.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: Long polling (increasing the ReceiveMessage wait time) is a feature that helps reduce the number of empty API calls to SQS, making message retrieval more efficient, especially for queues that are often empty. It does not prevent a message from being processed multiple times if the visibility timeout is too short.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: While changing to an SQS FIFO queue with message deduplication could prevent duplicate processing, it's a more significant architectural change than simply adjusting the visibility timeout on a standard queue. FIFO queues have different characteristics (e.g., stricter ordering, potentially lower throughput limits without careful design) and might be overkill if the problem is solely due to the visibility timeout. Adjusting the visibility timeout is a simpler first step with less operational overhead.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: Deleting the message from the SQS queue before processing is complete is a bad practice. If the Lambda function fails during the image processing or email sending steps after the message has been deleted, the event (and the task to process the image) will be lost permanently, leading to unprocessed images rather than duplicate emails. Messages should only be deleted after successful completion of the task.

  <summary>Question 99</summary>

A company is implementing a shared storage solution for a gaming application that is hosted in an on-premises data center. The company needs the ability to use Lustre clients to access data. The solution must be fully managed.

Which solution meets these requirements?

- [ ] A. Create an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway. Create a file share that uses the required client protocol. Connect the application server to the file share.
- [ ] B. Create an Amazon EC2 Windows instance. Install and configure a Windows file share role on the instance. Connect the application server to the file share.
- [ ] C. Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system, and configure it to support Lustre. Attach the file system to the origin server. Connect the application server to the file system.
- [ ] D. Create an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. Attach the file system to the origin server. Connect the application server to the file system.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] D. Create an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. Attach the file system to the origin server. Connect the application server to the file system.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] Amazon FSx for Lustre: This AWS service provides fully managed, high-performance file systems that are optimized for compute-intensive workloads. It is based on Lustre, a popular open-source parallel file system. This directly meets the requirement for a storage solution that "Lustre clients" can access.
- [ ] Fully Managed: Amazon FSx for Lustre is a fully managed service. AWS handles the setup, patching, and maintenance of the file system hardware and software, which aligns with the requirement that "The solution must be fully managed."
- [ ] Access from On-Premises: FSx for Lustre file systems can be accessed from on-premises clients (like the gaming application servers in the company's data center) over an AWS Direct Connect connection or an AWS VPN. The phrase "Attach the file system to the origin server" implies making it accessible to the on-premises application server.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: An AWS Storage Gateway file gateway provides a file interface (NFS or SMB) to data stored in Amazon S3. It does not provide a Lustre file system interface or support Lustre clients.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: Creating a Windows file share on an Amazon EC2 instance uses the SMB/CIFS protocol, not Lustre. Furthermore, this solution is not "fully managed" in the same way as FSx for Lustre; the company would be responsible for managing the EC2 instance, the Windows operating system, and the file share configuration.
- [ ] Option C is wrong because: Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) provides scalable file storage primarily using the NFS protocol. EFS does not natively support the Lustre file system or protocol, nor can it be "configured to support Lustre." For Lustre-specific needs, Amazon FSx for Lustre is the appropriate AWS service.

  <summary>Question 100</summary>

A company's containerized application runs on an Amazon EC2 instance. The application needs to download security certificates before it can communicate with other business applications. The company wants a highly secure solution to encrypt and decrypt the certificates in near real time. The solution also needs to store data in highly available storage after the data is encrypted.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- [ ] A. Create AWS Secrets Manager secrets for encrypted certificates. Manually update the certificates as needed. Control access to the data by using fine-grained IAM access.
- [ ] B. Create an AWS Lambda function that uses the Python cryptography library to receive and perform encryption operations. Store the function in an Amazon S3 bucket.
- [ ] C. Create an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key. Allow the EC2 role to use the KMS key for encryption operations. Store the encrypted data on Amazon S3.
- [ ] D. Create an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key. Allow the EC2 role to use the KMS key for encryption operations. Store the encrypted data on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

- [ ] C. Create an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key. Allow the EC2 role to use the KMS key for encryption operations. Store the encrypted data on Amazon S3.

Why this is the correct answer:

- [ ] AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) for Secure Encryption/Decryption: AWS KMS is a managed service that makes it easy to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data. Using a customer-managed key (CMK) in KMS gives you control over the key material and its usage policies. KMS performs cryptographic operations (encrypt, decrypt) in a secure manner, often utilizing FIPS 140-2 validated hardware security modules. This addresses the need for a "highly secure solution to encrypt and decrypt the certificates in near real time."
- [ ] IAM Role for EC2 Access to KMS: The EC2 instance running the containerized application can be granted permissions to use the specific KMS key for encryption and decryption operations via an IAM role attached to the instance. This is a secure way to grant permissions without hardcoding credentials.
- [ ] Amazon S3 for Highly Available Storage: After the certificates (or sensitive data derived from them) are encrypted using KMS, they can be stored in Amazon S3. S3 is designed for high durability (99.999999999%) and availability, automatically storing data across multiple Availability Zones within a region. This meets the requirement to "store data in highly available storage after the data is encrypted."
- [ ] Least Operational Overhead: This solution leverages fully managed AWS services (KMS for key management and cryptographic operations, S3 for storage, IAM for permissions). This significantly minimizes the operational overhead compared to building and managing custom cryptographic solutions or less available storage options.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

- [ ] Option A is wrong because: While AWS Secrets Manager is excellent for storing and managing secrets like full certificates or private keys, the question emphasizes the need to "encrypt and decrypt the certificates in near real time," suggesting the application might be handling sensitive components of certificates or data related to them that require cryptographic operations. KMS is the service for performing these encryption/decryption operations using managed keys. Secrets Manager is more about storing the final secret value. "Manually update the certificates as needed" also points to operational overhead that might be reduced with other automated solutions for certificate lifecycle, though that's not the primary focus of the encryption/decryption requirement here.
- [ ] Option B is wrong because: Creating a custom AWS Lambda function with a Python cryptography library to perform encryption operations means the company would be responsible for managing the cryptographic implementation, key management, security of the keys, and the operational aspects of the Lambda function. This introduces significant development and operational overhead and potential security risks compared to using a purpose-built, managed, and validated service like AWS KMS.
- [ ] Option D is wrong because: While using AWS KMS with an EC2 role for encryption operations is correct, storing the encrypted data on Amazon EBS volumes is less ideal for "highly available storage" compared to Amazon S3 for this use case. Standard EBS volumes are zonal resources (tied to a specific Availability Zone). While EBS is reliable, achieving high availability across AZs for EBS-stored data requires additional mechanisms like replication or frequent snapshots and restoration procedures, which adds operational overhead. S3 provides high availability and durability across multiple AZs by default for object storage.
