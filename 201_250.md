  <summary>Question 201</summary>

A company is developing a marketing communications service that targets mobile app users. The company needs to send confirmation messages with Short Message Service (SMS) to its users. The users must be able to reply to the SMS messages. The company must store the responses for a year for analysis. What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

-   [ ] A. Create an Amazon Connect contact flow to send the SMS messages. Use AWS Lambda to process the responses.
-   [ ] B. Build an Amazon Pinpoint journey. Configure Amazon Pinpoint to send events to an Amazon Kinesis data stream for analysis and archiving.
-   [ ] C. Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to distribute the SMS messages. Use AWS Lambda to process the responses.
-   [ ] D. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) FIFO topic. Subscribe an Amazon Kinesis data stream to the SNS topic for analysis and archiving.

  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] B. Build an Amazon Pinpoint journey. Configure Amazon Pinpoint to send events to an Amazon Kinesis data stream for analysis and archiving.
   

Why these are the correct answers:

B. Build an Amazon Pinpoint journey. Configure Amazon Pinpoint to send events to an Amazon Kinesis data stream for analysis and archiving.

-   [ ] Amazon Pinpoint is designed for marketing communication and supports sending and receiving SMS messages.
-   [ ] Amazon Pinpoint journeys allow you to create automated messaging campaigns.
-   [ ] Pinpoint can be configured to send events to a Kinesis data stream, enabling real-time analysis and archiving of responses.
-   [ ] This solution meets all the requirements: sending SMS, receiving replies, and storing responses for analysis.
   

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. Amazon Connect is a cloud-based contact center service, not primarily designed for automated marketing SMS campaigns. While it can send SMS, it is not the most suitable service for this scenario.
-   [ ] C. Amazon SQS is a message queuing service and is not designed for sending SMS messages. It is used for queuing messages between applications.
-   [ ] D. Amazon SNS is a publish/subscribe messaging service, not designed for two-way SMS communication or managing conversations. FIFO topics provide ordering, which is not a primary requirement here, and SNS does not directly handle SMS replies in a conversational manner.

Therefore, Option B is the most appropriate solution for the marketing communications service.
