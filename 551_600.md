A company has a financial application that produces reports. The reports average 50 KB in size and are stored in Amazon S3. The reports are frequently accessed during the first week after production and must be stored for several years. The reports must be retrievable within 6 hours.

Which solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

-   [ ] A. Use S3 Standard. Use an S3 Lifecycle rule to transition the reports to S3 Glacier after 7 days.
-   [ ] B. Use S3 Standard. Use an S3 Lifecycle rule to transition the reports to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 7 days.
-   [ ] C. Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Configure S3 Intelligent-Tiering to transition the reports to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) and S3 Glacier.
-   [ ] D. Use S3 Standard. Use an S3 Lifecycle rule to transition the reports to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 7 days.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] A. Use S3 Standard. Use an S3 Lifecycle rule to transition the reports to S3 Glacier after 7 days.

Why this is the correct answer:

A. Use S3 Standard. Use an S3 Lifecycle rule to transition the reports to S3 Glacier after 7 days.

-   [ ] S3 Standard is suitable for frequently accessed data, meeting the requirement for access during the first week.
-   [ ] S3 Lifecycle rules automate the transition of objects between storage classes.
-   [ ] Transitioning to S3 Glacier after 7 days balances cost-effectiveness and the 6-hour retrieval requirement. S3 Glacier has a retrieval time of a few hours, which fits the needs.
-   [ ] This solution is cost-effective because S3 Glacier is cheaper for long-term storage compared to S3 Standard.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] B. S3 Standard-IA is for less frequently accessed data. Since the reports are frequently accessed in the first week, this is not ideal.
-   [ ] C. S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically moves data based on access patterns, which adds complexity without a clear cost benefit over using lifecycle rules for known access patterns.
-   [ ] D. S3 Glacier Deep Archive has the lowest storage cost but a longer retrieval time (typically within 12 hours), which does not meet the 6-hour requirement.

Therefore, Option A is the most cost-effective solution that meets the access and retrieval requirements.

-   [ ] C. Purchase All Upfront Reserved Instances for a 1-year term.
-   [ ] D. Purchase an All Upfront EC2 Instance Savings Plan for a 1-year term.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] B. Purchase a No Upfront Compute Savings Plan for a 1-year term.

Why this is the correct answer:

B. Purchase a No Upfront Compute Savings Plan for a 1-year term.

-   [ ] Compute Savings Plans provide significant cost savings and flexibility.
-   [ ] No Upfront Savings Plans do not require any initial payment, which helps with cost optimization.
-   [ ] Compute Savings Plans allow you to change the EC2 instance type and family, which is necessary since the company changes instances every 2-3 months.
-   [ ] A 1-year term provides a good balance between commitment and flexibility.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A, C, and D. Reserved Instances and EC2 Instance Savings Plans commit you to specific instance types or families, reducing flexibility and not accommodating the need to change instances frequently. All Upfront options also require a large initial payment.

Therefore, Option B is the best choice for cost optimization and flexibility in changing EC2 instances.

A company runs an application in a VPC with public and private subnets. The VPC extends across multiple Availability Zones. The application runs on Amazon EC2 instances in private subnets. The application uses an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. A solutions architect needs to design a secure solution to establish a connection between the EC2 instances and the SQS queue. Which solution will meet these requirements?

-   [ ] A. Implement an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon SQS. Configure the endpoint to use the private subnets. Add to the endpoint a security group that has an inbound access rule that allows traffic from the EC2 instances that are in the private subnets.
-   [ ] B. Implement an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon SQS. Configure the endpoint to use the public subnets. Attach to the interface endpoint a VPC endpoint policy that allows access from the EC2 instances that are in the private subnets.
-   [ ] C. Implement an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon SQS. Configure the endpoint to use the public subnets. Attach an Amazon SQS access policy to the interface VPC endpoint that allows requests from only a specified VPC endpoint.
-   [ ] D. Implement a gateway endpoint for Amazon SQS. Add a NAT gateway to the private subnets. Attach an IAM role to the EC2 instances that allows access to the SQS queue.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] A. Implement an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon SQS. Configure the endpoint to use the private subnets. Add to the endpoint a security group that has an inbound access rule that allows traffic from the EC2 instances that are in the private subnets.

Why this is the correct answer:

A. Implement an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon SQS. Configure the endpoint to use the private subnets. Add to the endpoint a security group that has an inbound access rule that allows traffic from the EC2 instances that are in the private subnets.

-   [ ] Interface VPC endpoints enable you to connect to AWS services privately within your VPC, without exposing your instances to the internet.
-   [ ] Configuring the endpoint in the private subnets ensures that the traffic to SQS does not leave the VPC.
-   [ ] Security groups act as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances. By adding an inbound rule, you control which traffic is allowed to access the endpoint, providing an additional layer of security.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] B and C. Configuring the interface VPC endpoint in the public subnets would require traffic to traverse the public subnets, which is less secure than keeping it within the private subnets.
-   [ ] D. Gateway endpoints are used for S3 and DynamoDB, not for SQS. Using a NAT gateway would allow the instances to access SQS, but it is less secure and has higher operational overhead compared to interface VPC endpoints.

Therefore, Option A is the most secure and efficient solution for connecting EC2 instances in private subnets to an SQS queue.

A solutions architect is using an AWS CloudFormation template to deploy a three-tier web application. The web application consists of a web tier and an application tier that stores and retrieves user data in Amazon DynamoDB tables. The web and application tiers are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, and the database tier is not publicly accessible. The application EC2 instances need to access the DynamoDB tables without exposing API credentials in the template. What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

-   [ ] A. Create an IAM role to read the DynamoDB tables. Associate the role with the application instances by referencing an instance profile.
-   [ ] B. Create an IAM role that has the required permissions to read and write from the DynamoDB tables. Add the role to the EC2 instance profile, and associate the instance profile with the application instances.
-   [ ] C. Use the parameter section in the AWS CloudFormation template to have the user input access and secret keys from an already-created IAM user that has the required permissions to read and write from the DynamoDB tables.
-   [ ] D. Create an IAM user in the AWS CloudFormation template that has the required permissions to read and write from the DynamoDB tables. Use the GetAtt function to retrieve the access and secret keys, and pass them to the application instances through the user data.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] B. Create an IAM role that has the required permissions to read and write from the DynamoDB tables. Add the role to the EC2 instance profile, and associate the instance profile with the application instances.

Why this is the correct answer:

B. Create an IAM role that has the required permissions to read and write from the DynamoDB tables. Add the role to the EC2 instance profile, and associate the instance profile with the application instances.

-   [ ] IAM roles provide a secure way to grant permissions to EC2 instances to access AWS services without embedding credentials directly in the instances or CloudFormation templates.
-   [ ] An instance profile is a container for an IAM role that you can associate with an EC2 instance.
-   [ ] This approach ensures that the application instances can access DynamoDB using the permissions granted by the IAM role, without exposing any API credentials.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. While creating an IAM role is correct, simply referencing an instance profile without adding the role to it will not grant the necessary permissions.
-   [ ] C. Using the parameter section to input access and secret keys exposes the credentials, which is a security risk.
-   [ ] D. Creating an IAM user in the CloudFormation template and passing the credentials through user data also exposes the credentials, which is insecure.

Therefore, Option B is the most secure and recommended way to grant permissions to EC2 instances to access DynamoDB.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] B. Use Amazon EMR to process the S3 data. Use Amazon EMR with the Amazon Redshift data to enrich the S3 data.

Why this is the correct answer:

B. Use Amazon EMR to process the S3 data. Use Amazon EMR with the Amazon Redshift data to enrich the S3 data.

-   [ ] Amazon EMR is a managed Hadoop framework that can process large amounts of data in parallel, making it suitable for processing the semi-structured data in S3.
-   [ ] EMR can also connect to and process data from Amazon Redshift, allowing for data enrichment.
-   [ ] This solution provides a unified platform for both processing the S3 data and integrating the Redshift data.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. Amazon Athena is suitable for querying data in S3 using SQL but is not as powerful for complex data processing as EMR. AWS Glue is primarily an ETL service, not a processing platform.
-   [ ] C. While EMR can process the S3 data, using Kinesis Data Streams to move the S3 data into Redshift is not efficient for batch processing and adds unnecessary complexity.
-   [ ] D. AWS Glue is an ETL service, not designed for processing large amounts of data. AWS Lake Formation is a service for building data lakes, not for data processing.

Therefore, Option B is the most appropriate solution for parallel data processing and enriching S3 data with Redshift data.

-   [ ] D. Use AWS CloudFormation templates to create accounts in Organizations. Use the drift detection operation on a stack to identify the changes to the OU hierarchy.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] A. Provision the AWS accounts by using AWS Control Tower. Use account drift notifications to identify the changes to the OU hierarchy.

Why this is the correct answer:

A. Provision the AWS accounts by using AWS Control Tower. Use account drift notifications to identify the changes to the OU hierarchy.

-   [ ] AWS Control Tower provides a way to set up and govern a secure, multi-account AWS environment.
-   [ ] Control Tower offers account drift detection, which can identify changes to the OU hierarchy and notify the operations team.
-   [ ] This solution is designed to manage and monitor multi-account environments, minimizing operational overhead.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] B. AWS Config can monitor resource configurations but is not specifically designed to track OU hierarchy changes in the same way as Control Tower's drift detection.
-   [ ] C. AWS Service Catalog is used for creating and managing catalogs of IT services, not for tracking OU hierarchy changes. CloudTrail records API calls but requires more effort to monitor and interpret OU changes.
-   [ ] D. AWS CloudFormation is used for provisioning resources, not for monitoring OU hierarchy changes. Drift detection in CloudFormation is for resource configuration changes within a stack, not OU changes.

Therefore, Option A is the most suitable solution for identifying and notifying changes to the OU hierarchy with the least operational overhead.

  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] A. Create a route table entry for the endpoint.
-   [ ] B. Create a gateway endpoint for DynamoDB.

Why these are the correct answers:

A. Create a route table entry for the endpoint.

-   [ ] To ensure that traffic to DynamoDB goes through the endpoint, you need to add a route to the route table associated with the subnets where your EC2 instances reside.
-   [ ] This route directs traffic destined for DynamoDB to the gateway endpoint.

B. Create a gateway endpoint for DynamoDB.

-   [ ] Gateway endpoints for DynamoDB enable you to connect to DynamoDB from within your VPC without traversing the internet.
-   [ ] This provides secure and private connectivity.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] C. Interface endpoints are used for services like API Gateway and Kinesis, not DynamoDB.
-   [ ] D. You don't need to create an elastic network interface for gateway endpoints. They are managed differently from interface endpoints.
-   [ ] E. Security groups are used to control traffic to EC2 instances, not to gateway endpoints.

Therefore, Options A and B are the correct steps to ensure API calls to DynamoDB do not travel across the internet.

-   [ ] D. Store sensitive data in Amazon FSx for Windows Server. Mount the file share on application servers. Use Windows file permissions to restrict access.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] B. Store sensitive data in Amazon RDS for MySQL. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) client-side encryption to encrypt the data.

Why this is the correct answer:

B. Store sensitive data in Amazon RDS for MySQL. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) client-side encryption to encrypt the data.

-   [ ] Client-side encryption with AWS KMS allows the application itself to encrypt the data before it is sent to the database.
-   [ ] This ensures that the data is encrypted at rest and in transit, and even database administrators cannot see the decrypted data.
-   [ ] Amazon RDS for MySQL provides a managed database service, simplifying operations.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. EBS encryption encrypts data at rest on the volume, but database administrators with access to the EC2 instances or the underlying storage can potentially access the unencrypted data.
-   [ ] C. S3 server-side encryption encrypts data at rest in S3, but it does not protect the data from database administrators.
-   [ ] D. Amazon FSx for Windows Server and Windows file permissions do not provide the level of protection needed to prevent database administrators from accessing sensitive data.

Therefore, Option B is the most secure solution to protect sensitive customer data, even from database administrators.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] A. Check for metrics in Amazon CloudWatch in the namespace for AWS/Events.

Why this is the correct answer:

A. Check for metrics in Amazon CloudWatch in the namespace for AWS/Events.

-   [ ] Amazon CloudWatch provides metrics for AWS services, including EventBridge.
-   [ ] The `AWS/Events` namespace contains metrics related to EventBridge rules, such as `Invocations`, `MatchedEvents`, and `FailedInvocations`.
-   [ ] By monitoring these metrics, you can determine if the rule conditions are being met (MatchedEvents) and if the target is being invoked (Invocations).

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] B. Amazon SQS dead-letter queues (DLQs) are used to store messages that fail to be processed by SQS queues. They are not directly related to EventBridge rule invocations.
-   [ ] C. CloudWatch Logs are used for logging application or service output, not for monitoring EventBridge rule metrics.
-   [ ] D. AWS CloudTrail records API calls made within your AWS account. While it can show EventBridge API calls, it does not provide metrics on rule conditions or target invocations.

Therefore, Option A is the most suitable solution for monitoring EventBridge rule behavior.

-   [ ] A. Use a local machine to create a certificate that is signed by the third-party Clmport the certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). Create an HTTP API in Amazon API Gateway with a custom domain. Configure the custom domain to use the certificate.

Why this is the correct answer:

A. Use a local machine to create a certificate that is signed by the third-party Clmport the certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). Create an HTTP API in Amazon API Gateway with a custom domain. Configure the custom domain to use the certificate.

-   [ ]   This option allows for the use of a specific third-party CA, as the certificate is created locally and then imported into ACM.
-   [ ]   Amazon API Gateway supports custom domains with TLS certificates, enabling the use of TLSv1.3.
-   [ ]   This setup provides the necessary control over the certificate and TLS version for the API endpoints.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ]   B, C, and D. AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) does not directly issue certificates signed by an arbitrary third-party CA. ACM primarily issues certificates or allows importing certificates that you've obtained elsewhere. Options C and D also involve Lambda function URLs, which are not the typical way to handle custom domains and certificates for REST APIs.

Therefore, Option A is the most suitable solution to meet the requirements for TLS version and specific CA.

A company wants to use an event-driven programming model with AWS Lambda. The company wants to reduce startup latency for Lambda functions that run on Java 11. The company does not have strict latency requirements for the applications. The company wants to reduce cold starts and outlier latencies when a function scales up. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

-   [ ] A. Configure Lambda provisioned concurrency.
-   [ ] B. Increase the timeout of the Lambda functions.
-   [ ] C. Increase the memory of the Lambda functions.
-   [ ] D. Configure Lambda SnapStart.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] D. Configure Lambda SnapStart.

Why this is the correct answer:

D. Configure Lambda SnapStart.

-   [ ]   Lambda SnapStart improves startup performance for Java 11 Lambda functions by initializing the function and saving a snapshot of the execution environment.
-   [ ]   When the function is invoked, Lambda resumes from the snapshot, reducing cold starts and improving latency.
-   [ ]   This is a cost-effective way to reduce cold starts without the ongoing cost of provisioned concurrency.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ]   A. Provisioned concurrency keeps Lambda functions initialized, reducing cold starts, but it incurs costs for the provisioned concurrency, even when not in use.
-   [ ]   B. Increasing the timeout does not reduce cold starts; it only allows the function more time to execute.
-   [ ]   C. Increasing memory can sometimes improve performance but does not directly address cold starts as effectively as SnapStart.

Therefore, Option D is the most cost-effective solution to reduce cold starts for Java 11 Lambda functions.

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] A. Migrate the existing RDS for MySQL database to an Aurora Serverless v2 MySQL database cluster.

Why this is the correct answer:

A. Migrate the existing RDS for MySQL database to an Aurora Serverless v2 MySQL database cluster.

-   [ ]   Aurora Serverless v2 is designed for infrequent, short-lived workloads. It automatically scales capacity up or down based on application needs and can pause when not in use, significantly reducing costs.
-   [ ]   This aligns perfectly with the requirement to operate the application for only 2 hours per week.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ]   B. Aurora MySQL database clusters are provisioned, and you pay for the instance capacity even when not in use, making it less cost-effective for short-duration usage.
-   [ ]   C. Running MySQL on an EC2 instance and purchasing a reservation might reduce costs compared to on-demand instances, but it still incurs costs when the database is idle, and managing EC2 instances adds operational overhead.
-   [ ]   D. Using Amazon ECS to run MySQL containers is complex and not cost-effective for a database that is only needed for 2 hours per week.

Therefore, Option A is the most cost-effective solution for running the database for short periods each week.

A company runs a stateful production application on Amazon EC2 instances. The application requires at least two EC2 instances to always be running. A solutions architect needs to design a highly available and fault-tolerant architecture for the application. The solutions architect creates an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances. Which set of additional steps should the solutions architect take to meet these requirements?

-   [ ] A. Set the Auto Scaling group's minimum capacity to two. Deploy one On-Demand Instance in one Availability Zone and one On-Demand Instance in a second Availability Zone.
-   [ ] B. Set the Auto Scaling group's minimum capacity to four. Deploy two On-Demand Instances in one Availability Zone and two On-Demand Instances in a second Availability Zone.
-   [ ] C. Set the Auto Scaling group's minimum capacity to two. Deploy four Spot Instances in one Availability Zone.
-   [ ] D. Set the Auto Scaling group's minimum capacity to four. Deploy two On-Demand Instances in one Availability Zone and two Spot Instances in a second Availability Zone.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] B. Set the Auto Scaling group's minimum capacity to four. Deploy two On-Demand Instances in one Availability Zone and two On-Demand Instances in a second Availability Zone.

Why this is the correct answer:

B. Set the Auto Scaling group's minimum capacity to four. Deploy two On-Demand Instances in one Availability Zone and two On-Demand Instances in a second Availability Zone.

-   [ ]   Setting the minimum capacity to four ensures that at least four instances are always running, meeting the requirement for at least two instances.
-   [ ]   Deploying instances across two Availability Zones provides high availability and fault tolerance. If one AZ fails, instances in the other AZ can continue to serve traffic.
-   [ ]   Using On-Demand Instances ensures that the instances are available when needed, as opposed to Spot Instances, which can be interrupted.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ]   A. Setting the minimum capacity to two only meets the minimum requirement but does not provide redundancy within each AZ.
-   [ ]   C. Spot Instances can be interrupted, which does not guarantee high availability for a stateful production application.
-   [ ]   D. Combining On-Demand and Spot Instances does not provide consistent availability, as Spot Instances can be interrupted.

Therefore, Option B is the most suitable solution for a highly available and fault-tolerant architecture.

  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] A. Set up a geolocation routing policy. Send the traffic that is near us-west-1 to the on-premises data center. Send the traffic that is near eu-central-1 to eu-central-1.

Why this is the correct answer:

A. Set up a geolocation routing policy. Send the traffic that is near us-west-1 to the on-premises data center. Send the traffic that is near eu-central-1 to eu-central-1.

-   [ ]   Geolocation routing allows you to route traffic based on the geographic location of your users.
-   [ ]   By directing users to the closest location (on-premises or eu-central-1), you minimize latency and improve load times.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ]   B. A simple routing policy does not provide the sophisticated routing capabilities of geolocation routing.
-   [ ]   C. Latency routing policy routes traffic based on the lowest latency, but it might not always align with the desired geographic routing.
-   [ ]   D. A weighted routing policy distributes traffic based on assigned weights, not location, and does not guarantee minimal load times based on user location.

Therefore, Option A is the most suitable solution for minimizing load time based on user location.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] A. Run the EC2 instances in a spread placement group.

Why this is the correct answer:

A. Run the EC2 instances in a spread placement group.

-   [ ]   Spread placement groups ensure that EC2 instances are placed on distinct underlying hardware.
-   [ ]   This is crucial for applications that require high availability or need to avoid sharing resources with other instances.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ]   B. Grouping instances in separate accounts does not guarantee that they won't share the same hardware.
-   [ ]   C. Dedicated tenancy ensures that instances run on hardware dedicated to a single customer, but it's more expensive and not necessary for simply preventing groups of nodes from sharing hardware.

Why this is the correct answer:

C. Use dynamic scaling to change the size of the Auto Scaling group.

-   [ ]   Dynamic scaling adjusts the number of EC2 instances in response to real-time metrics, such as CPU utilization or network traffic.
-   [ ]   This allows the application to automatically scale up during sudden traffic increases, maintaining performance.
-   [ ]   Dynamic scaling is cost-effective because you only pay for the resources you use.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ]   A. Manual scaling is not suitable for sudden traffic increases as it requires manual intervention, which is not timely.
-   [ ]   B. Predictive scaling uses historical data to forecast traffic, but it is not effective for random, unpredictable increases.
-   [ ]   D. Schedule scaling is based on a predetermined schedule and does not respond to sudden, unexpected traffic changes.

Therefore, Option C is the most appropriate and cost-effective solution for handling unpredictable traffic increases.

An ecommerce application uses a PostgreSQL database that runs on an Amazon EC2 instance. During a monthly sales event, database usage increases and causes database connection issues for the application. The traffic is unpredictable for subsequent monthly sales events, which impacts the sales forecast. The company needs to maintain performance when there is an unpredictable increase in traffic. Which solution resolves this issue in the MOST cost-effective way?

-   [ ] A. Migrate the PostgreSQL database to Amazon Aurora Serverless v2.
-   [ ] B. Enable auto scaling for the PostgreSQL database on the EC2 instance to accommodate increased usage.
-   [ ] C. Migrate the PostgreSQL database to Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL with a larger instance type.
-   [ ] D. Migrate the PostgreSQL database to Amazon Redshift to accommodate increased usage.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] A. Migrate the PostgreSQL database to Amazon Aurora Serverless v2.

Why this is the correct answer:

A. Migrate the PostgreSQL database to Amazon Aurora Serverless v2.

-   [ ]   Aurora Serverless v2 automatically scales database capacity based on application needs, handling unpredictable traffic.
-   [ ]   It is cost-effective because you only pay for the capacity you use, scaling down when not in use.
-   [ ]   This solution minimizes operational overhead and ensures consistent performance.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ]   B. Auto scaling PostgreSQL on an EC2 instance is complex to set up and manage, and it might not scale as efficiently as Aurora Serverless v2.
-   [ ]   C. Migrating to a larger RDS instance is not cost-effective, as you pay for the instance size even when not fully utilized.
-   [ ]   D. Amazon Redshift is a data warehouse and not suitable for transactional database workloads.

Therefore, Option A is the most cost-effective and efficient solution for handling unpredictable traffic.

  <summary>Question 597</summary>

A company hosts an internal serverless application on AWS by using Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda. The company's employees report issues with high latency when they begin using the application each day. The company wants to reduce latency. Which solution will meet these requirements?

-   [ ] A. Increase the API Gateway throttling limit.
-   [ ] B. Set up a scheduled scaling to increase Lambda provisioned concurrency before employees begin to use the application each day.
-   [ ] C. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to initiate a Lambda function as a target for the alarm at the beginning of each day.
-   [ ] D. Increase the Lambda function memory.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] B. Set up a scheduled scaling to increase Lambda provisioned concurrency before employees begin to use the application each day.

Why this is the correct answer:

B. Set up a scheduled scaling to increase Lambda provisioned concurrency before employees begin to use the application each day.

-   [ ]   Provisioned concurrency keeps Lambda functions initialized and ready to respond, reducing cold starts and improving latency.
-   [ ]   Scheduling this concurrency ensures that it is available when employees start using the application, addressing the high latency issue.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ]   A. Increasing the API Gateway throttling limit does not address Lambda cold starts.
-   [ ]   C. Using a CloudWatch alarm to trigger a Lambda function is not as efficient as provisioned concurrency for reducing latency.
-   [ ]   D. Increasing Lambda function memory can sometimes improve performance but does not directly address cold starts.

Therefore, Option B is the most suitable solution for reducing latency caused by Lambda cold starts.

A research company uses on-premises devices to generate data for analysis. The company wants to use the AWS Cloud to analyze the data. The devices generate .csv files and support writing the data to an SMB file share. Company analysts must be able to use SQL commands to query the data. The analysts will run queries periodically throughout the day. Which combination of steps will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? (Choose three.)

-   [ ] A. Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway on premises in Amazon S3 File Gateway mode.
-   [ ] B. Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway on premises in Amazon FSx File Gateway made.
-   [ ] C. Set up an AWS Glue crawler to create a table based on the data that is in Amazon S3.
-   [ ] D. Set up an Amazon EMR cluster with EMR File System (EMRFS) to query the data that is in Amazon S3. Provide access to analysts.
-   [ ] E. Set up an Amazon Redshift cluster to query the data that is in Amazon S3. Provide access to analysts.
-   [ ] F. Setup Amazon Athena to query the data that is in Amazon S3. Provide access to analysts.

-   [ ] A. Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway on premises in Amazon S3 File Gateway mode.
-   [ ] C. Set up an AWS Glue crawler to create a table based on the data that is in Amazon S3.
-   [ ] F. Setup Amazon Athena to query the data that is in Amazon S3. Provide access to analysts.

Why these are the correct answers:

A. Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway on premises in Amazon S3 File Gateway mode.

-   [ ]   AWS Storage Gateway in S3 File Gateway mode allows on-premises applications to store data in Amazon S3 using the SMB protocol.
-   [ ]   This enables the devices to write .csv files to S3 as if they were writing to a local file share.

C. Set up an AWS Glue crawler to create a table based on the data that is in Amazon S3.

-   [ ]   AWS Glue crawlers can automatically infer the schema of the .csv files in S3 and create a table in the AWS Glue Data Catalog.
-   [ ]   This makes the data queryable using SQL.

F. Setup Amazon Athena to query the data that is in Amazon S3. Provide access to analysts.

-   [ ]   Amazon Athena allows you to query data in S3 using SQL.
-   [ ]   It integrates with the AWS Glue Data Catalog, enabling analysts to query the .csv files efficiently.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ]   B. AWS Storage Gateway in FSx File Gateway mode is for accessing Amazon FSx file systems, not for storing data from on-premises devices.
-   [ ]   D. Amazon EMR is more suitable for complex data processing and analysis, not for simple SQL queries. It is also more expensive for this use case.
-   [ ]   E. Amazon Redshift is a data warehouse and is more expensive and complex than Athena for querying data in S3.

Therefore, Options A, C, and F provide the most cost-effective solution for storing the data from on-premises devices and querying it with SQL.
