A company has a financial application that produces reports. The reports average 50 KB in size and are stored in Amazon S3. The reports are frequently accessed during the first week after production and must be stored for several years. The reports must be retrievable within 6 hours.

Which solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

-   [ ] A. Use S3 Standard. Use an S3 Lifecycle rule to transition the reports to S3 Glacier after 7 days.
-   [ ] B. Use S3 Standard. Use an S3 Lifecycle rule to transition the reports to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 7 days.
-   [ ] C. Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Configure S3 Intelligent-Tiering to transition the reports to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) and S3 Glacier.
-   [ ] D. Use S3 Standard. Use an S3 Lifecycle rule to transition the reports to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 7 days.

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] A. Use S3 Standard. Use an S3 Lifecycle rule to transition the reports to S3 Glacier after 7 days.

Why this is the correct answer:

A. Use S3 Standard. Use an S3 Lifecycle rule to transition the reports to S3 Glacier after 7 days.

-   [ ] S3 Standard is suitable for frequently accessed data, meeting the requirement for access during the first week.
-   [ ] S3 Lifecycle rules automate the transition of objects between storage classes.
-   [ ] Transitioning to S3 Glacier after 7 days balances cost-effectiveness and the 6-hour retrieval requirement. S3 Glacier has a retrieval time of a few hours, which fits the needs.
-   [ ] This solution is cost-effective because S3 Glacier is cheaper for long-term storage compared to S3 Standard.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] B. S3 Standard-IA is for less frequently accessed data. Since the reports are frequently accessed in the first week, this is not ideal.
-   [ ] C. S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically moves data based on access patterns, which adds complexity without a clear cost benefit over using lifecycle rules for known access patterns.
-   [ ] D. S3 Glacier Deep Archive has the lowest storage cost but a longer retrieval time (typically within 12 hours), which does not meet the 6-hour requirement.

Therefore, Option A is the most cost-effective solution that meets the access and retrieval requirements.

-   [ ] A. Purchase Partial Upfront Reserved Instances for a 3-year term.
-   [ ] B. Purchase a No Upfront Compute Savings Plan for a 1-year term.
-   [ ] C. Purchase All Upfront Reserved Instances for a 1-year term.
-   [ ] D. Purchase an All Upfront EC2 Instance Savings Plan for a 1-year term.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] B. Purchase a No Upfront Compute Savings Plan for a 1-year term.

Why this is the correct answer:

B. Purchase a No Upfront Compute Savings Plan for a 1-year term.

-   [ ] Compute Savings Plans provide significant cost savings and flexibility.
-   [ ] No Upfront Savings Plans do not require any initial payment, which helps with cost optimization.
-   [ ] Compute Savings Plans allow you to change the EC2 instance type and family, which is necessary since the company changes instances every 2-3 months.
-   [ ] A 1-year term provides a good balance between commitment and flexibility.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A, C, and D. Reserved Instances and EC2 Instance Savings Plans commit you to specific instance types or families, reducing flexibility and not accommodating the need to change instances frequently. All Upfront options also require a large initial payment.

Therefore, Option B is the best choice for cost optimization and flexibility in changing EC2 instances.

A company runs an application in a VPC with public and private subnets. The VPC extends across multiple Availability Zones. The application runs on Amazon EC2 instances in private subnets. The application uses an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. A solutions architect needs to design a secure solution to establish a connection between the EC2 instances and the SQS queue. Which solution will meet these requirements?

-   [ ] A. Implement an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon SQS. Configure the endpoint to use the private subnets. Add to the endpoint a security group that has an inbound access rule that allows traffic from the EC2 instances that are in the private subnets.
-   [ ] B. Implement an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon SQS. Configure the endpoint to use the public subnets. Attach to the interface endpoint a VPC endpoint policy that allows access from the EC2 instances that are in the private subnets.
-   [ ] C. Implement an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon SQS. Configure the endpoint to use the public subnets. Attach an Amazon SQS access policy to the interface VPC endpoint that allows requests from only a specified VPC endpoint.
-   [ ] D. Implement a gateway endpoint for Amazon SQS. Add a NAT gateway to the private subnets. Attach an IAM role to the EC2 instances that allows access to the SQS queue.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] A. Implement an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon SQS. Configure the endpoint to use the private subnets. Add to the endpoint a security group that has an inbound access rule that allows traffic from the EC2 instances that are in the private subnets.

Why this is the correct answer:

A. Implement an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon SQS. Configure the endpoint to use the private subnets. Add to the endpoint a security group that has an inbound access rule that allows traffic from the EC2 instances that are in the private subnets.

-   [ ] Interface VPC endpoints enable you to connect to AWS services privately within your VPC, without exposing your instances to the internet.
-   [ ] Configuring the endpoint in the private subnets ensures that the traffic to SQS does not leave the VPC.
-   [ ] Security groups act as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances. By adding an inbound rule, you control which traffic is allowed to access the endpoint, providing an additional layer of security.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] B and C. Configuring the interface VPC endpoint in the public subnets would require traffic to traverse the public subnets, which is less secure than keeping it within the private subnets.
-   [ ] D. Gateway endpoints are used for S3 and DynamoDB, not for SQS. Using a NAT gateway would allow the instances to access SQS, but it is less secure and has higher operational overhead compared to interface VPC endpoints.

Therefore, Option A is the most secure and efficient solution for connecting EC2 instances in private subnets to an SQS queue.

A solutions architect is using an AWS CloudFormation template to deploy a three-tier web application. The web application consists of a web tier and an application tier that stores and retrieves user data in Amazon DynamoDB tables. The web and application tiers are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, and the database tier is not publicly accessible. The application EC2 instances need to access the DynamoDB tables without exposing API credentials in the template. What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

-   [ ] A. Create an IAM role to read the DynamoDB tables. Associate the role with the application instances by referencing an instance profile.
-   [ ] B. Create an IAM role that has the required permissions to read and write from the DynamoDB tables. Add the role to the EC2 instance profile, and associate the instance profile with the application instances.
-   [ ] C. Use the parameter section in the AWS CloudFormation template to have the user input access and secret keys from an already-created IAM user that has the required permissions to read and write from the DynamoDB tables.
-   [ ] D. Create an IAM user in the AWS CloudFormation template that has the required permissions to read and write from the DynamoDB tables. Use the GetAtt function to retrieve the access and secret keys, and pass them to the application instances through the user data.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] B. Create an IAM role that has the required permissions to read and write from the DynamoDB tables. Add the role to the EC2 instance profile, and associate the instance profile with the application instances.

Why this is the correct answer:

B. Create an IAM role that has the required permissions to read and write from the DynamoDB tables. Add the role to the EC2 instance profile, and associate the instance profile with the application instances.

-   [ ] IAM roles provide a secure way to grant permissions to EC2 instances to access AWS services without embedding credentials directly in the instances or CloudFormation templates.
-   [ ] An instance profile is a container for an IAM role that you can associate with an EC2 instance.
-   [ ] This approach ensures that the application instances can access DynamoDB using the permissions granted by the IAM role, without exposing any API credentials.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. While creating an IAM role is correct, simply referencing an instance profile without adding the role to it will not grant the necessary permissions.
-   [ ] C. Using the parameter section to input access and secret keys exposes the credentials, which is a security risk.
-   [ ] D. Creating an IAM user in the CloudFormation template and passing the credentials through user data also exposes the credentials, which is insecure.

Therefore, Option B is the most secure and recommended way to grant permissions to EC2 instances to access DynamoDB.

A solutions architect manages an analytics application. The application stores large amounts of semi-structured data in an Amazon S3 bucket. The solutions architect wants to use parallel data processing to process the data more quickly. The solutions architect also wants to use information that is stored in an Amazon Redshift database to enrich the data. Which solution will meet these requirements?

-   [ ] A. Use Amazon Athena to process the S3 data. Use AWS Glue with the Amazon Redshift data to enrich the S3 data.
-   [ ] B. Use Amazon EMR to process the S3 data. Use Amazon EMR with the Amazon Redshift data to enrich the S3 data.
-   [ ] C. Use Amazon EMR to process the S3 data. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to move the S3 data into Amazon Redshift so that the data can be enriched.
-   [ ] D. Use AWS Glue to process the S3 data. Use AWS Lake Formation with the Amazon Redshift data to enrich the S3 data.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] B. Use Amazon EMR to process the S3 data. Use Amazon EMR with the Amazon Redshift data to enrich the S3 data.

Why this is the correct answer:

B. Use Amazon EMR to process the S3 data. Use Amazon EMR with the Amazon Redshift data to enrich the S3 data.

-   [ ] Amazon EMR is a managed Hadoop framework that can process large amounts of data in parallel, making it suitable for processing the semi-structured data in S3.
-   [ ] EMR can also connect to and process data from Amazon Redshift, allowing for data enrichment.
-   [ ] This solution provides a unified platform for both processing the S3 data and integrating the Redshift data.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. Amazon Athena is suitable for querying data in S3 using SQL but is not as powerful for complex data processing as EMR. AWS Glue is primarily an ETL service, not a processing platform.
-   [ ] C. While EMR can process the S3 data, using Kinesis Data Streams to move the S3 data into Redshift is not efficient for batch processing and adds unnecessary complexity.
-   [ ] D. AWS Glue is an ETL service, not designed for processing large amounts of data. AWS Lake Formation is a service for building data lakes, not for data processing.

Therefore, Option B is the most appropriate solution for parallel data processing and enriching S3 data with Redshift data.

-   [ ] C. Set up a VPC peering connection between the VPCs. Update the route tables of each VPC to use the VPC peering connection for inter-VPC communication.

Why this is the correct answer:

C. Set up a VPC peering connection between the VPCs. Update the route tables of each VPC to use the VPC peering connection for inter-VPC communication.

-   [ ] VPC peering allows you to connect two VPCs and route traffic between them privately.
-   [ ] It is the most cost-effective and straightforward solution for connecting two VPCs within the same region and account, especially for moderate data transfer volumes.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] A. AWS Transit Gateway is designed for connecting many VPCs and on-premises networks. It is more complex and expensive than VPC peering for just two VPCs.
-   [ ] B. Site-to-Site VPN is used for connecting VPCs to on-premises networks over the internet. It adds overhead and cost compared to VPC peering for intra-region connectivity.
-   [ ] D. AWS Direct Connect is used for dedicated network connections between on-premises and AWS. It is not cost-effective for connecting two VPCs in the same region.

Therefore, Option C is the most cost-effective solution for connecting the two VPCs.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

-   [ ] A. Provision the AWS accounts by using AWS Control Tower. Use account drift notifications to identify the changes to the OU hierarchy.
-   [ ] B. Provision the AWS accounts by using AWS Control Tower. Use AWS Config aggregated rules to identify the changes to the OU hierarchy.
-   [ ] C. Use AWS Service Catalog to create accounts in Organizations. Use an AWS CloudTrail organization trail to identify the changes to the OU hierarchy.
-   [ ] D. Use AWS CloudFormation templates to create accounts in Organizations. Use the drift detection operation on a stack to identify the changes to the OU hierarchy.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] A. Provision the AWS accounts by using AWS Control Tower. Use account drift notifications to identify the changes to the OU hierarchy.

Why this is the correct answer:

A. Provision the AWS accounts by using AWS Control Tower. Use account drift notifications to identify the changes to the OU hierarchy.

-   [ ] AWS Control Tower provides a way to set up and govern a secure, multi-account AWS environment.
-   [ ] Control Tower offers account drift detection, which can identify changes to the OU hierarchy and notify the operations team.
-   [ ] This solution is designed to manage and monitor multi-account environments, minimizing operational overhead.

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ] B. AWS Config can monitor resource configurations but is not specifically designed to track OU hierarchy changes in the same way as Control Tower's drift detection.
-   [ ] C. AWS Service Catalog is used for creating and managing catalogs of IT services, not for tracking OU hierarchy changes. CloudTrail records API calls but requires more effort to monitor and interpret OU changes.
-   [ ] D. AWS CloudFormation is used for provisioning resources, not for monitoring OU hierarchy changes. Drift detection in CloudFormation is for resource configuration changes within a stack, not OU changes.

Therefore, Option A is the most suitable solution for identifying and notifying changes to the OU hierarchy with the least operational overhead.
