A solutions architect is creating a data processing job that runs once daily and can take up to 2 hours to complete. If the job is interrupted, it has to restart from the beginning. How should the solutions architect address this issue in the MOST cost-effective manner?

-   [ ] A. Create a script that runs locally on an Amazon EC2 Reserved Instance that is triggered by a cron job.
-   [ ] B. Create an AWS Lambda function triggered by an Amazon EventBridge scheduled event.
-   [ ] C. Use an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) Fargate task triggered by an Amazon EventBridge scheduled event.
-   [ ] D. Use an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) task running on Amazon EC2 triggered by an Amazon EventBridge scheduled event.

  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] C. Use an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) Fargate task triggered by an Amazon EventBridge scheduled event.

Why this is the correct answer:

C. Use an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) Fargate task triggered by an Amazon EventBridge scheduled event.

-   [ ]   Amazon ECS Fargate allows you to run containers without managing the underlying EC2 instances. [cite: 739, 740, 741, 742, 743, 744, 745]
-   [ ]   Fargate is cost-effective for tasks with consistent runtime, and EventBridge provides reliable scheduling. [cite: 742, 743, 744, 745]
-   [ ]   ECS tasks can be configured to restart on failure, ensuring the job completes. [cite: 740, 741, 742, 743, 744, 745]

Why are the other answers wrong?

-   [ ]   A. EC2 Reserved Instances are cost-effective for long-running workloads, not for a daily 2-hour job. [cite: 742, 743]
-   [ ]   B. Lambda functions have execution time limits that may not be suitable for a 2-hour job. [cite: 743, 744]
-   [ ]   D. ECS tasks on EC2 require managing EC2 instances, which is more complex and less cost-effective than Fargate. [cite: 744, 745]

Therefore, Option C is the most cost-effective and efficient solution for the given requirements.
