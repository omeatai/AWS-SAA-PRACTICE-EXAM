Why these are the correct answers:

B. Grant the decrypt permission for the Lambda IAM role in the KMS key's policy

-   [ ] The KMS key policy must allow the Lambda function's IAM role to use the key for decryption.
-   [ ] This gives the Lambda function permission to decrypt the files.

E. Create a new IAM role with the kms:decrypt permission and attach the execution role to the Lambda function.

-   [ ] Lambda functions assume an IAM role that grants them permissions to access AWS resources.
-   [ ] This role needs the `kms:decrypt` permission to allow the function to decrypt files.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

-   [ ] A and C. Resource policies are not the primary way to grant KMS permissions to Lambda functions.
-   [ ] D. Creating and attaching an IAM policy to the Lambda function is correct, but Option E is more precise about using an IAM *role*.
