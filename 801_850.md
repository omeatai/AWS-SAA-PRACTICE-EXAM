<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] B.
    Set up an AWS Storage Gateway Amazon S3 File Gateway. Use an Amazon S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data to the appropriate storage class.

Why this is the correct answer:

-   [ ]
    AWS Storage Gateway File Gateway allows you to store data in Amazon S3 while providing local access to applications via file protocols.
-   [ ]
    S3 Lifecycle policies automate the movement of data to lower-cost storage classes, optimizing costs.
-   [ ]
    This is cost-effective because you leverage S3's scalability and cost-efficiency.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

-   [ ]
    A. Volume Gateway presents block storage to on-premises applications, which is not suitable for file-based workloads and is generally more expensive than S3.
-   [ ]
    C and D. Amazon EFS is a scalable file storage service for use with EC2 instances. While it provides file storage, it is generally more expensive than S3 for large-scale data storage, and using infrequent access tiers does not provide the same cost optimization as S3 Lifecycle policies.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] D.
    Configure provisioned concurrency for the Lambda functions. Increase the memory according to AWS Compute Optimizer recommendations.

Why this is the correct answer:

-   [ ]
    Provisioned concurrency keeps Lambda functions initialized and ready to respond, minimizing cold starts and maintaining low latency.
-   [ ]
    Increasing memory can improve CPU performance for Lambda functions, as Lambda allocates CPU power proportionally to memory.
-   [ ]
    AWS Compute Optimizer provides recommendations for optimizing Lambda function memory allocation based on performance data.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

-   [ ]
    A. Reserved concurrency helps to manage concurrency but does not eliminate cold starts or improve CPU performance. Decreasing memory would likely worsen CPU performance.
-   [ ]
    B. Reserved concurrency does not address cold starts. Increasing memory without considering Compute Optimizer recommendations might not be cost-effective.
-   [ ]
    C. Provisioned concurrency helps with cold starts, but decreasing memory would likely reduce CPU performance.

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] A.
    Use Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) as a private image repository to store the container images. Specify scan on push filters for the ECR basic scan.

Why this is the correct answer:

-   [ ]
    Amazon ECR can scan container images for vulnerabilities when they are pushed to the repository.
-   [ ]
    This integrates directly with the container image storage and requires minimal changes to the workload deployment process.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

-   [ ]
    B. Amazon Macie is a data security and privacy service that discovers sensitive data in S3, not for scanning container images for CVEs. This solution is not designed for this purpose.
-   [ ]
    C. Deploying workloads to Amazon EKS is not necessary for scanning container images. ECR can scan images regardless of where they are deployed.
-   [ ]
    D. Storing images in S3 and using Lambda and Inspector adds complexity and is not as efficient as using ECR's built-in scanning.

  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] C.
    Instruct the vendor to create a Network Load Balancer (NLB). Place the NLB in front of the Amazon RDS for MySQL database. Use AWS PrivateLink to integrate the company's VPC and the vendor's VPC.

Why this is the correct answer:

-   [ ]
    AWS PrivateLink allows you to access services across VPCs and accounts privately, without traversing the internet.
-   [ ]
    An NLB in front of the RDS database enables PrivateLink to access the database.
-   [ ]
    This solution works even without an internet gateway, Direct Connect, or Site-to-Site VPN.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

-   [ ]
    A. Direct Connect requires a physical connection and is not needed for this scenario. VPC peering alone does not provide access without a network connection.
-   [ ]
    B. Client VPN is for individual users to connect to a VPC, not for VPC-to-VPC communication. VPC peering alone is insufficient.
-   [ ]
    D. Transit Gateway is for connecting multiple VPCs and on-premises networks, not necessary for this point-to-point connection. VPC peering alone is insufficient.

A solutions architect runs a web application on multiple Amazon EC2 instances that are in individual target groups behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Users can reach the application through a public website. The solutions architect wants to allow engineers to use a development version of the website to access one specific development EC2 instance to test new features for the application. The solutions architect wants to use an Amazon Route 53 hosted zone to give the engineers access to the development instance. The solution must automatically route to the development instance even if the development instance is replaced. Which solution will meet these requirements?

-   [ ] A.
    Create an A Record for the development website that has the value set to the ALB. Create a listener rule on the ALB that forwards requests for the development website to the target group that contains the development instance.
-   [ ] B.
    Recreate the development instance with a public IP address. Create an A Record for the development website that has the value set to the public IP address of the development instance.
-   [ ] C.
    Create an A Record for the development website that has the value set to the ALB. Create a listener rule on the ALB to redirect requests for the development website to the public IP address of the development instance.
-   [ ] D.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

-   [ ] A.
    Create an A Record for the development website that has the value set to the ALB. Create a listener rule on the ALB that forwards requests for the development website to the target group that contains the development instance.

Why this is the correct answer:

-   [ ]
    Creating an A Record pointing to the ALB allows Route 53 to resolve the development website to the ALB.
-   [ ]
    An ALB listener rule can then route traffic based on the hostname to the specific target group with the development instance.
-   [ ]
    If the development instance is replaced, the ALB will automatically update its target group, ensuring consistent routing.

<hr> Why are the other answers wrong? <hr>

-   [ ]
    B. Using a public IP address for the development instance is not recommended for security and requires updating the Route 53 record if the IP changes.
-   [ ]
    C. Redirecting from the ALB to an instance's public IP is less efficient and does not provide the flexibility of ALB routing. It also has the same issue with IP address changes.
-   [ ]
    D. Placing all instances in the same target group defeats the purpose of isolating the development instance.

A company is designing an event-driven order processing system. Each order requires multiple validation steps after the order is created. An idempotent AWS Lambda function performs each validation step. Each validation step is independent from the other validation steps. Individual validation steps need only a subset of the order event information. The company wants to ensure that each validation step Lambda function has access to only the information from the order event that the function requires. The components of the order processing system should be loosely coupled to accommodate future business changes. Which solution will meet these requirements?

-   [ ] A.
    Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue for each validation step. Create a new Lambda function to transform the order data to the format that each validation step requires and to publish the messages to the appropriate SQS queues. Subscribe each validation step Lambda function to its corresponding SQS queue.
-   [ ] B.
    Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Subscribe the validation step Lambda functions to the SNS topic. Use message body filtering to send only the required data to each subscribed Lambda function.
